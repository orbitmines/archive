2025. Progress Update: I missed last years' progress update, but here is this years'! Some design notes on the programming language and IDE I'm currently working on.

My current predicated timeline for my projects is something like this:
- 2026: Have a functioning runtime ; just a v0 specification runtime, without any optimizations which I can run in the browser. At the end of the year I'm hoping to make a language specification book which I'll update periodically.
- 2027: Start work on the IDE: Ether, and start lifting the Ray's language constraints of being text-based
- 2028: Using the IDE, create functionality for the analysis, indexing and implementation in/of other programming languages: A start to the library project.
- 2029: Think about turning the Ether into a fully-fledged rendering engine for 3d-environments/physics/games.
- 2030-2035 Start research on gamification of science, engineering & (technical) education
