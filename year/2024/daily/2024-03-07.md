old;

Just recalled [[Stephen Wolfram]] mentioned being dissapointed noone has build an interface for something like this yet - links a bit back to a several years ago when I first thought of this.

typed but not sent in [[Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research (SEMF)]]:
Huh, in the Wolfram Physics case for Causal Multiway Systems the Confluence/Causal Invariance relation is automatically represented by this, where the `.self` ray just also contains a reference to what is considered as history. (This then also being the place where types/additional structure more generally lives)

	- "Now that I've started reading some of Aleks Kissingers work this eivdently seems like a nice way to conceptualize "Special Commutitive Frobenius Algebras" which the formal way of describing hypergraphs is based on - " - cancelled message to [[Carlos Zapata Carratal√°]] - I'll probably name it in the call in a "am I understanding correctly" - kind of way.

Can implement the ignorances through those traversal layers on branches which dont go left/right but only one direction? SHould ahve a better handle on those ideas.


it';s the freference thing, evidently you can reference things without a direction connection, the point is not to ignore that idea, but to try to find a way to phrqase that that's possible to setup
