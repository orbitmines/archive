Homotopy equivalence thing for collapsing an entire graph/ray to a single point is similar to copying again, move from one vertex which branches into two, is similar to having a ray which holds the initial on either side. Basically just removing the left one, this being the mechanism to collapse the entire graph to a point. Where in the case of cohomoloy, something stops this from happening. Additional structure at each of the points perhbaps? ANother layer of descriptionwhich says there's something in between.
