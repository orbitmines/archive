is_equiv = a.self().traverse().is_orbit(b.self().traverse())  
Basically: does there exist a single connection between the two?  
  
Only difference is the assymetry of is_orbit and the consequences of that if self/initial/terminal all are is_orbit that of another  
  
Reverse direction as teo points. Need a good intuition for this. Basically one of tep values selected and the switching of direction to the other way. Perhaps similarly a tep step modular structure of which you can see the intial/terminals being swapped. Is_equiv if can tell the difference and ignore, is_orbit if cannot  
  
What does this structure for logic look like - get an intuition.  
  
How to specify any vs all in a case like this?. Place it at the level which checks the equiv, default is any. Then all if applied on INITIAL not VERTEX.
