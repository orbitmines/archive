Reverse a modular binary, no difference except for the time step  
  
Can have an orbit with 5 initials to a single vertex, that vertex at .self has an initial which maps 5 vertices to those 5 initials. But what is an additional selection of value in this case? A vertex on vertex in the .self??  
  
Infrageometry spinal graphs ; ternsry edge is a modular 3 connected vertices in a circle. As opposed to three pairwise "bags".

Separate precense checks as "spinal" as well, and references. So structure as precense checks, references as what additionally is there. That waysuperposed we care about the type we're rewriting? Needs better thinking..  
  
Types as boolean values in 3-size arrays  
[0,0,0],[1,0,0] instead of seperate func for each one,
