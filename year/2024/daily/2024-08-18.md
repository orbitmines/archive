Coherence in type information vs coherence in value. Only the former for binary op  
  
Initial,self,terminal as 3 sepwrate pointers, or as whole, and saying they're already directly the ewuivalence rays.  
  
Always finite, but with modular property, so *as_iterable always returns finite rays. But still carries the modular info how?
