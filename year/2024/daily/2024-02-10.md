Most definitions and/or names of things assume some perspective

I'm exploring possible projects to join and/or possibilities for funding:  
  
Supposedly, this starts with a few simple admissions.  
  
I'm someone with relentless curiosity. Though, so far, that has always come with an inevitabe sharp disinterest when something more interesting was found. This probably explains the tendency I have to move to execute my own projects.  
  
So concretely, if someone knows of funding possibilities I've failed to already consider - to extend my timeline and @OrbitMines projects (A high-level overview can be found here: [https://github.com/orbitmines/orbitmines.com/issues](https://github.com/orbitmines/orbitmines.com/issues)). Or if anyone knows of a project looking for someone for a couple of months and dares to think that might peak my interest; This is me: [https://orbitmines.com/profiles/fadi-shawki](https://orbitmines.com/profiles/fadi-shawki)  
  
There is no category of project/position I exclude from this, I'll be interested to find out what kind of things pop up when I give no constraints. Though a useful technical context might be that I hate all programming languages equally (i.e. I don't care much which I'm using and adapt quickly).
