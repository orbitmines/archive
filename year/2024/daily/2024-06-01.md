Separate example of homoiconicity, move along/switch position through two local changes, or something more interesting  
  
at the end simple example of efficiency/closeness/differentiability  
  
perhaps simple inconsistent differences between different logic sustems as an example for superposed languages or do that at the rendering engine section with pixels  
  
could also do simple superposing of operators  
  
Could like the practical ignorance/intelligence to partially reversible ignorant compression - or just ignore these for now
