Can phrase the conceptual extremes as an assumption of halting at the boundary, clearly then you consteuct from there the idra, what if that wasn't the case - it not being the boundary at all. Hence the words pointing to some extreme are more accurately phrased as an assumption like that; "But there could be arbitrary structure there which is ignored"  
  
could use the pond dance as an example, "dont need to know to predict"

How about for physics, initial tries to go to initial, terminal to terminal, and self stays in place by default if there's something around it? Next tick tries again and if the others have not moved it stays the same
