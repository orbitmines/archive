Wasn't going to send this for another month or so, but now I'm curious to find out either way. 
  
If I fail to find some funding to extend my timeline (by a year or two) in a next few months. I'll probably be looking to join a project for a couple of months.  
  
So if anyone knows of one looking for someone with relentless curiosity inevitably met with a sharp disinterest the moment I think I've found something more interesting: That'll be right up my alley.  
  
Fyi; I hate all programming languages equally (i.e. I don't care much which I'm using and adapt quickly).
