# OrbitMines - The Story  
*This is a story about confusion. A story about a long struggle to discover this world's Universal Language.*  
  
Yet, somehow it also seems like a mirror-image of me.

*Chapter I - June 22 2024*  
  
It began, well - ha. It began, as you might expect. In an ordinary classroom. Not just any classroom, No. No, this was a room which little magic iPads. Why you might ask? The answer to that question remained hidden to me for many years to come.  
  
Everywhere the kids went, so went their little tablets. And through them the power to create worlds. Worlds like none thought even remotely possible. Yet, even though this was so obvious, not enough of them had true understanding of what this meant.  
  
For me however, this was of course obvious. Starting with a little game called Minecraft: A videogame with the potential to be as creative or destructive as you liked. A game which did not hold back any suprises. Truely a world without limits.  
  
And so, naturally, I was drawn to that world. To create universes of chaos, chaos so beautiful you could still see its overmarching order. An order which was unrelentless. I speak of course, not only of Minecraft.  
  
For it is possible to discover this world's most terrifying features, with mere babysteps. To realize that every step carries responsibility. That being listened to, and understood, are Two Different Things entirely.  
  
I have gone through what one might call incredibly swift stages of confusion. Yet to me it was so obvious: I was simply marching along the unrelentless story of giants before me. Yet this little hobbit could see so much further. So, so much further.  
  
I will give you a little taste of this journey, perhaps you could pick up the pieces.  
  
If of course, you can tolerate my vague ambiguity every once in a blue moon. Then then this store might be something for you...  
  
## Arc I  
*Chapter II - June 23 2024*  
  
Now this hobbit is a bit of a nasty one. Not only is he a proudfoot, *"proodfeet", I mean. But he is a bit of Mule too. Why a Mule?  
  
Perhaps you haven't heard of Asimov "et al")'s books. You see, a Mule is a sort of an outlier. An outlier who unknowingly consumes the world around him. This is no mere accident. The Germans would probably stumble in naming him sort of a Blitz"Mule" (whatever 'mule' means in German, I care not to look it up right now). Hence, here we are. A happy little accident.  
  
Another "Perhaps", perhaps, might be that it may come as a surprise to you, that an intelligence, must necessarily be ignorant. Of course, what better way to forget one's strength by hitting a red button for one stupid reason or another. For the non-gamer noobs among us: this is a strategy I like to call "button-mashing" - entirely invented this word myself, like the Great Shakespear, Hallowed be His Name.  
  
The metaverse, or should I call it programming, I keep forgetting the difference, is therefore not something you can build. It is just the setting off of a single domino. A single domino will set off your fall.  
  
This is the besuty and the horror of reprogrammability, or should I already call it life, who knows? It is the co-existence of the exploration of extremes. To hack, and be hacked by your loved ones. To see the beauty in something you cannot begin to comprehend. An actual choice, how hard for you.  
  
Now that this Accidental Mule has stepped on the gas, I might as well conjecture that most of your so-called "open problems" in science are probably all the same problem. A conceptual problem. The only thing you actually need for them is a little craziness on your horizon.  
  
Perhaps, again, all you lack is a dirty mirror....

*Chapter III - August 25 2024*  

You see, the problem the Mule had, was that his restless pursuit made him blind to the obvious. Unable to contain himself to his own little universe. Unable to give an allowance to boredom. In his blindness, a fuel for his energy was sought. A yearning which did not satisfy easily.

Surprisingly, it doesn't matter much how stable you think your mind is. In an instant, a single bit-flip of being blind is enough to send you on that pursuit-train. In that obsessive search, never looking back, never contemplating the path that sent you there.

And so it was for this pretend-Mule, that on an unsuspecting evening in May after having spent some time with friends, the unexpected happened. Tired yet unable to sleep, I bought a ticket on that train which led me down this multi-month journey to find back coherence. Though an amusing tale, its details matter little. The fact that your mind can enter a fail-mode itself says enough, and evidently that it can do so with striking regularity.

---

There's this quote I find myself back to often: "Cannot even imagine it - this has always been a problem for our kind". Though its context is way off, it still rings an expanding truth. I could not imagine this fail-mode as a possibility, in the blindness I could not imagine a way out of it. 

In any case, now in Fallen Kingdom style, I'm still picking up the pieces. Perhaps it's time for yet another parody. Or perhaps I will silently finish this Arc until perhaps the second one can be built, this time away from confusion, that time towards a better building.

Until realization catches up with imagined dreams.
