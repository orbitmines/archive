Extremes: natural / unnatural, subjectivity, objectivity, their relation to arbitrary, Provability, another extreme, causes confusion; [comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:G%C3%B6del_machine), utopia, fairness, freedom, unbiased., equality
Perfect, imprecisise...
Freedom, highly analogous with abundance/calmness? In the sense that freedom
rational, another one, indifference, impossibility, never, something 'is' something

arbitrary / impossible; generally not the case (conservation of energy)
An example of arbitrary-ness. Introduce the concept that arbitrary is never truely arbitrary, it's contextual.
discriminate, choosing, spectrum, degrees of, / as opposed to flux ..
(reference to that paper which mentions natural language as a formal language)
flux/superposition
inner state memory is a sensor under the curent definition (moving information)
Names of a function, cryptographic hashes, etc...

Frank Herbert: 'If you must name the absolute, use it's appropriate name; temporary'

Asimov's mentioning of 'Never' say never (Second Foundation)

example:

Something like emergence (*better way of defining it as, initially unrelated to some abstract concept, do the very thing of that abstract concept. Some incredibly complex biological process, doing addition or something) Continuing patterns of people coming up with a term for something, it being incorporated in the usual way of thinking and them people keep pointing out that the term is invalid or not appropriate.

Take a JSON file with a known size. Even though the specification of JSON contains self-references and can be infinite, this is somewhat misleading. Infinities in this case are *NOT* truely infinite in contexts like these. Say like here the size of the file is known, ex: how many bytes. Assumptions can be made on the actual limit of this thing, and infinitely large nested objects cannot possibly be a thing. This of course is trickier with a possible infinite stream, BUT can be reduced because of other possible environmental properties which effect this possible cardinality. (25/03/2022: Take the power being cut from an external system which presumably supplies this infinite stream of bytes, it can be interrupted by an arbitrary number of reasons)

Create a link between extremes and (contextual) inhibitory behavior, these extreme concepts would then explain why they have their impossible characteristics, based on how a system responds. An example would be the idea of incomplete knowledge, (self-referential) uncertainty allowing for the analogy that there is no such thing as complete knowledge, and all knowledge is necessarily incomplete. Yet then for practical purposes, we allow/perceive the concept of complete knowledge in the form of strong inhibitory behavior. For the perception is still a possibility, yet abstractly we can say there is no such thing.

These sorts of things are quite related to the idea of infinite regression. Infinities themselves aren't necessarily always problematic, in some cases like clocks (; or a way of telling time), they are actually preferred. I believe the idea behind different kinds of infinities is generally quite well understood. [ref to some examples]
