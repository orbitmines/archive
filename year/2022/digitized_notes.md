A Node2 which self-referentially references the whole system.
- How? Infinite 'realized' regression; how to solve? (Sometimes random exploration)
- How does categorization/classification arise? Simply from grouping links (context) as similar/relevant. Simply variable (abstract/superpositioned) 'logic' serving as a base. X->X (identity, etc.)
- co-dependence?

Initial functionality at whether a possibility of infinity (conceptually) exists. Finiteness playing a crucial role.

Usefulness; Need to adress this, how?
- fruitful (perhaps compression as the useful metric -> where storage/sequential nodes are not penalized for their left-right encoding.)
- ignor(ance)
- causality/predictiveness/consequences
- functional equivalence
- computational resources
- perceived fidelity
- conjectures (in the extremes and other appropriate ones)

Collapsing the structure in its a compressed short form. Using the same algorithm as used for compression? Or let that be an important fundament for the whole thing.

Implementing (self-referentially) the algorithm of building up conceptual links in the graph. -> Addition and other things deduced?

Pressures (context); How to influence decision making. Time spent on same general thing bring a main function.

superposition ; confusion ; prediction.

How can the system function if at any arbitrary time-step its structure could be altered from outside. To some extent it'll have to rely on its foundation, but the structure it uses to reason could be immune to certain alterations. (Robustness as a consequence; or more so at least)

Basic Manipulation of Nodes

Node2: a sequence of symbols with a specific cardinality.
I: A symbol is merely an abstraction and seen as a possible Node2 itself.
II: A symbol & Node2 each have a cardinality.
III: Initial conditions allow for the checking of equality of two Nodes. This equality, is initially only *exactly* the same. Same cardinality, same permutation (not the same location). The system will learn from here how to re-perceive something of another cardinality and equate it like that.

Analogies the program should make: from Agents which stem from these the usage of them should spike interest in them to possibly induce revelations.

deletion: leave links pointing to it intact? When they are tried to be explored they act as forget this link, why? Is it useful to delete this reference also?

Location
- Initial conditions are a System which has a Node2 which holds the abstract link-like behavior.

Interaction
- Nodes representing arbitrary information in the sense of a value. Which self referentially is implemented as a sequencing of a cardinal value.

    R: [R | Node2 | B]

    Node2: Node2 | [Node2]

I: The initial conditions allowing (perception starts at this re-framing) far functionality which expands / reduces these to Nodes which are again the item of a sequence.
II: Comparison of these self-referential (sameness starts here) variables as another fundamental instruction.

Node2 -> self-referential information representation (sequencing starts here)

Agent; (abstractly in System at every time step)
Abstractly an initial Node2 being the reference to the current timestep, and previous links the timeline of decisions. Where the links are contextual to Location, Interaction, Selection. (+ predicates -> possible expansions) -> probing arbitrary functions.

Selection/Navigation
- uncertainty (self-referential)
- infinity (conceptual)is born.
- urgency
- contextual selection (conditional logic starts here) -> noise
- paths already travelled are inhibitory behavior/context
- innate uncertainty (limits on rationality)
- learning/usefulness (combined with context)
- test extremes

Time (simultaneity / parallelism)
- arbitrary time-step, where the execution of one agent is simultaneous and that of many systems at this arbitrary time-step being parallelism. From this stems the fact that at a timestep for system A many could have happened for system B.
- Histories & time as contextual links. These (contextually) should be ignored when not present.
