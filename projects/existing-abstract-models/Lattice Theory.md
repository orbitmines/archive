https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order) - Lacks the `.self` of Rays. So close... - It's probably about the difference between a single abstraction layer - the connection and the expanding of the continuations as a separate layer. Hence at any step to branch or to delay evaluation in the sense of INITIAL -> INITIAL / TERMINAL -> TERMINAL

- [ ] von neumann birhoff latice theory quantum physics -> Think they were missing the "ignorance" part of rays
