  - Steps to take to continue to project include;
    - Generalizing many functions to take any group presentation and produce a Cayley table.
    - Generalizing [[Categorica]] tools to allow for the construction of hom-functors, and the Yoneda embedding for any category. (this latter may require building a bit of Set)
    - Outlining a procedure for creating such a categorical representation of any formal theory.
    - Constructing some ‘common’ categorical structures to be the images of newly built [[Categorica#AbstractFunctor]] expressions.
