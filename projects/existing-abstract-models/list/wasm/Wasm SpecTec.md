    - While skipping through the talk, I found [[Andreas Rossberg]], there talking about [[WebAssembly]]. (Found his name only two days ago from the wasm spec commits) He's talking about [[Wasm SpecTec]], some DSL they're developing to formalize the wasm spec for - which they made themselves and intend to keep maintaining (' TODO Mentioned Ott/Lem,, but didnt fit the bill, what's this?). There's compilation (backend) to [[Lean]], [[Agda]], not yet [[Isabelle]], no [[OCaml]] yet?. / [[Coq]], [[LaTeX]], [[Haskell]], Tests. Prose/Sphinx.
