- Type theory alpha-equivalence, which defines that the two sides are equivalent to eachother ignoring the equivlency relation??
  - this idea is captues in type theory?

- [ ] COllapse to some simpler structure if no part is referenced by some other part (but they're ignorantly used, so can't actually know that, so we're just moving it around), the links could then in some rediscover mefchanism be setup

- [ ] Type is just the superposition of the character encoding ; This superposition just being at the frame? How does this generalize to arbitrary encodings beyond linear ones?

; cartesion closed category ; relevant for some or all morphisms (set of morphisms)?

- [ ] Dragging along the possible levels of description of what one is familiar with ; some fields, then the terms used in those languages... (abstract languages like category theory and the like) ; and so the possibility of switching to different abstractions

; (o)caml ; category theory origin..

- [ ] Compile to Type Theory, then compile to Category Theory from there? ; Would necessarily compile to monoidal categories I believe, let's see how much sense this makes once I grasp the category theory concepts a bit better.
