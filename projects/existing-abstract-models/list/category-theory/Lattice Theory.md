https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order) - Lacks the `.self` of Rays. So close... - It's probably about the difference between a single abstraction layer - the connection and the expanding of the continuations as a separate layer. Hence at any step to branch or to delay evaluation in the sense of INITIAL -> INITIAL / TERMINAL -> TERMINAL

- [ ] von neumann birhoff latice theory quantum physics -> Think they were missing the "ignorance" part of rays

**This is probably a very relevant thing: Where invariance in this case is something like a branching ray as a cursor along a ray indicating an invariance: i.e. copies over every entry.**

*"Also, interesting to note might be that Von Neumann and Birkhoff attempted to ground quantum mechanics using order theory (their attempt was not very successful at that)."
Me: "I think my intuition is trying to say something like. I want it ordered to talk about it usefully. But high-arity cases are probably more in line with ignoring/invariances of that order."*
