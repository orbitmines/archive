https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order) - Lacks the `.self` of Rays. So close... - It's probably about the difference between a single abstraction layer - the connection and the expanding of the continuations as a separate layer. Hence at any step to branch or to delay evaluation in the sense of INITIAL -> INITIAL / TERMINAL -> TERMINAL

- [ ] von neumann birhoff latice theory quantum physics -> Think they were missing the "ignorance" part of rays

**This is probably a very relevant thing: Where invariance in this case is something like a branching ray as a cursor along a ray indicating an invariance: i.e. copies over every entry.**
