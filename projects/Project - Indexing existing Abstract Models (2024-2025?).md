# Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)
*Once a proper interface for Rays is setup, one of the things I'd like to do with it, is to point it to a lot of existing abstract models of computation/mathematics/calculi/theorem-provers/compilers/proof assistants/automated program synthesizers/.../programming languages. And create a way of analyzing/comparing them which **does not** include manual human labor of specifying their grammars.*

- Rays are probably a [Characteristica_universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis) (Or rather a Universal Language, or as [[Jonathan Gorard]] phrased a similar concept; a "general theory of graphs" (See [[Category Theory]] notes when at [[Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research (SEMF)]]))

---

- [ ] This entire thing should be compiled into a writing/study of existing stuff

- [ ] Measurement of category if diversity for the thing its useful for
- [ ] 

---

- [ ] Whole project makes it necessary to get the practical low-level systems in this too.
	- [ ] Lookup existing projects in that space, decompilers, interfaces for binary analysis etc..

# Some interesting/pending questions regarding this project:
- [ ] What are mistakes in trying to spin up new projects/languages?
- [ ] What can be (partially) compiled to what using what? (Natively supported vs finding (accidental) symmetries to allow for compilation)
	- [ ] Apply this question again by loosely changing constraints?
- [ ] Compiled grammar vs analysis of runtimes?
- [ ] *Just exclude the ones without open licenses. ; or if the project is big enough might as well contact all of them to lift the licenses*
### Some other ways of possibly extending this list (non-completed tangents):

- [ ] Is there someone who has compiled something like this yet?
- [ ] All the people I've followed GitHub, Twitter, etc... & some distance away as preference
- [ ] Quick/automatic GitHub/.../Gitlab search.
