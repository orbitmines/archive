##### Superpose in more detail
  
- [ ] On 3-line, We could also do the interesting thing, of then taking the two existing lines which define a continuation, and connecting those together. 

---

Whether either end, once found in isolation, can have itself be linked conceptually to its counterpart, is the interesting question. ; What can we say about the information when we are missing or thinking corruption of it? - 


Not so sure about these points:
- [ ] Rewrite rules, accidently hitting some "speed up?":: Hence time/inconsistency/motion/acceleration could be conceptualized as some unmatched pattern/relation (where unmatched is no link to some frame) looking for something to latch onto, and usually it's the next one in some directionality, other tumes the skipped a few in that directionality or something completely different - though abstractly if course this would be generalized as its own directionality so this differentiation only makes sense in relation to something else. - What happens if you apply this quantum mechanically/or multicomputationally?  
- [ ] Unordered (directionalities), so non-directionalities, require parallelism in temporal directionalities. - Through you could always abstractly phrase them as having some directed parallelism, if one had to enumerate them. Is this the basis of what makes something non-directed? Or does this come from ignorance of the directed information had being unable to determine different permutations? - Hence necessarily stemming from uncertainty of following some directionality? - How could you ever do this not related to some parallrl ignorant directionalitirs?
- [ ] Matching to any part of some dorectionality in the following sense. One upper smaller one (saw two things), one larger one say three things. The lower one corresponding to normal movement, the other to higher level movement of say Ctrl+Move, similar to word movement using the keyboard. Then the points as an abstract pattern being able to match to any part of the directionality, as long as they're in succession, as long as they're three.
- [ ] Everything is connected to everything, inconsistent, and want to drop the edges. Actuall ignorant abstraction layer above it, with the disguinsihability with additional information. It's the edges with allow for differentiability. Triangle, point sbove it, ignorant connections. Symmetry, things allow for distinguishability is the memory of having rotated (disallow access, disallow the memory/conenction) ; Always additional structure to it is what defines the abstraction.
- [ ] generalize any notion/mention of "some dirextionality" to some arbitrarily structured directionality ehich contains arbitrarily many structures/directionalit
- [ ] "lens" of 3 things, ask on which places there is something, without needing to know what that something is. 3 binary values/ then you know what you are. Then one can switch to different contexts

The abstract idea of persistence is quite straight-forward:  non-trivially limits access to the previous 'steps'.

Ignoring Redundancies (; Skipping Equivalences)
Ignorant of its use - visualizing
###### Specific implementation questions/constraints
- [ ] **direction at the point**: What does it mean for a point yo become its own direction? 
	- [ ] The morphism is inconsistently a point across itself ?
	- [ ] I suspect the source of a great many human confusions would be the interpretation of the direction at the point, while simultaneously not being aware of that that's what abstractly been done.
	- [ ] direction as point think, as a confusion: The result and the processof getting there often confused or often ambiguous in language? ; Nearly, ..
- [ ] **zero**: Generalization of zero st the split point between opposite directionalities?  
	- [ ] 'zero' where distinguishability begins for some modular structure
	- [ ] **ALL vs one**: Still how to differentiate between ALL as opposed to just some matching pattern. Just some boundary condition of there being no X with property larger? - That certainly wont work arbitrarily
	- [ ] "ZERO" IS the terminal?!!! - it's on the edge, not the point, or if zero from a seleciton, then it's apoint
	- [ ] zero ary (zero input) choosing an element from the set - carlos - It's more genwral of some cross of the frame as the selextion/permutation of the encoding, how is this generalized, external inconsostency? realized by some non ignorant atep? - As a way of saying that the selection is ignorant
- [ ] **If unknown**, Practical guesses if the answer is unkown to trigger a response which will make a subsequent guess more accurate/correct
- [ ] **Tolerance of ambiguity** 
	- [ ] Enforce some single solution as opposed to allowing for misinterpretations to persist and either be adjusted differently later on ; wanting to converge to some value, limiting?
	- [ ] Is it the fixation on specific names there to proactively combat ambiguity (collectively on some scale?), allow for certain spaces to more easily searchable (& other resource management ideas)? What are the less attractive things brought from fixation on some uniformity of what some part of some language/.. represents. Lesser tolorance/ability/pressure to develop resolving to/of/.. ambiguities
	- [ ]  "Readiness to accept some supposed assumption in some context?" 
- [ ] Jump to extremes *assumed end

---
# Implementation
- Locally defined rewrite rules?

- [ ] Solving ambiguity with additional context,

- [ ] Function starts as a reference betfore more dtetail on vertex/terminal?
- Only thing needed for addition, is equivalencing initial/terminal. - Equivalencing continuations.  


- [ ] Making a non theorem a theorem holding all properties and symmetries except its initial violation. It's not necessarily: "But that's not inside the definition of what this thing is supposed to be" - it's merely, well apparently I can do this, so your abstraction/description/implementation/... is clearly ignorant of something (obviously).


- [ ] In reference to the idea of not having access to the details of what some point is, then gaining them, there is an ambiguity on where exactly one mentions the structure ; say not having access to a binary sequence, so having merely a point to reference the entire thing, and then gaining access at that point, which then holds the ambiguity of where in that sequence, or relative character one is able to grab onto the structure. Or if the grabbing is parallelized into multiple rays, then how those are distributed themselves again, up for ambiguity.  

- [ ] How to floating point numbers work?
	- [ ] There imprecision at some extreme in floating point numbers. Where this imprecision? Not always at the edge, not always inconsistency of assumed infinities at the edge, could be at any point? 


- [ ] Potentially important: distinguishability doesn't need to be abstractly realized, it could just be in the temporal mechanisms of the system.
	- [ ] Assumptions, perceived obvious ones left unsaid. Mention non-trivial reason to suppose that one might understand something? - NOt reanosable to suggest that certain things should be known in certain cases? - Only a formallized variant of something like this?


- [ ] **Non-commital ignorance:** perhaps undirectedness - or some non commital to what part of the structure is being latched onto phrased as a combination (similar to multiway-computation) where it merely allows all the possible connectivities (which abstractly reasned could ometimes be interpreted as probabilities at some other level of description)

- [ ] Different level of description (simulation) ; That this ignorance (; variance) doesn't matter, or can just be explicitly stated.
- [ ] "Can abstractly only satisfy a loop through another loop? While pattern matching?"
- [ ] General notion of constructing superpositions (; equivalences) or inconsistencies and enumerating possibilities
	- [ ] Expanding superpositions to there permutations (a simple rewrite rule?) - For the general case? (/combinatorics)
- [ ] Non-abstract realizations
	- [ ] Do you really need nothing/empty as a way to differentiate between a pattern and an actual empty one? Is this not encoded in rewrite functions?/ignorant ones?
	- [ ] Basically also this thing of, some type of assumption/proof - not need to check some thing
- [ ] Some way of implementing it in usual matrixes, 
- [ ] Modelling unknown systems - possibly to in the future match em - or directly something possibly not understood
	- [ ] Will have to kick in by having some way of realizing that externality - much more intuitive to phrase it this way, and see how it can be broken  
	- [ ] Conjecture, 
	  - Unknowns not yet verified with proposed consequences for either option?   
	  - Expectations/claims based on incompleteness of some intermediary step.  
	  - Also without expectation but simply an unsolved unknown.  

- [ ] How to know which parts are being observed?  
  - [ ] How to discover other observations not necessarily internally processed.  
    - [ ] Reference to hiding observations from the interface? Possibility is there, so should be described?  

- [ ] Brute-forcing if no better alternative has yet been found?  
- [ ] Notify me when you've found something you deem relevant for this unknown (while we dont know how to solve some unknown)
- [ ] How would additional capabilities be realized? More things done at some time step? What time step? (; more complex organization, controlled and uncontrolled)  / devices / resources
- [ ] Effectively random, like effective field equations, some idea from ignorance in the sense that: "might as well be truely random".  - unable to understand structure..
- [ ] Unknowns & inconsistencies driving curiosity?  

- [ ] This similar to homotopy type theory expanding possible types, or that "the most beaitufl program every written thing" which handles filling the "?" or theorem provers... - last one maybe more of finding something that matches the pattern?..

Partially = locally?
- [ ] Partiality/unresolved parts critical.  
	- [ ] How to define currently trying some directionality: waiting for some function, perhaps some partial state acquirable? 
	- [ ] Partial reversibility critical, same for superpositions and possible spaces (close to approximates).. 
	- [ ] Unresolved as: this computation was cut off/short? Unresolved: a pointer to continue investigation?
	- [ ] Recognizing structure but not it's name (failure to find a link): Recognizing properties/context, but not some specific property/attached representation.  
	- [ ] Deletion of information  
	- [ ] Hooking steps of the program:  
		- [ ] Already start doing something while decision is pending - do the things which one can reverse?  
		  - [ ] This would allow for the hooking of the process by a programmer: Hey while you're still working on this thing, perhaps [some answer to some function] should be considered, what would happen then? (Basically simulating an answer by a programmer ; some arbitrary process which hooks into a function)  
	- [ ] 'Unintended'/'Unrealized' effects realized? / Resources one didn't know one is consuming etc... (unknowns)  
- [ ] Against forgetting/violation/inconsistencies
	- [ ] Forgetting but remembering one has forgotten - structure, but acknowledgement, structure is missing.
	- [ ] It's crossing some directionality and finding one cannot return back? (That would imply next time step or something - any inconsistency possibly 
	- [ ] differently structurally forgetting
	- [ ] Testing/Simulating: Does a certain property still hold; what if not and deemed violated?  
	- [ ] How could failures be detected? How can failures be prevented? 
	- [ ] Redundancy: redundancy defined as aiding the resolving of unresolved values? (if compression is the goal: least redundant, if the goal is adaptability; sparsity)
	  - [ ] Run multiple simultaneous processes which are supposed to do the same thing - compare  
	- [ ] Self-imposed limitations to see if that can be sufficient  
		- [ ] "What if I were to treat this as forgotten, what would happen?"  
		- [ ]  - fidelity: If I don't check, I assume it will be consistent, if I do check, I assume the checking will be consistent. ; What to do when certain types of consistency fail?  
		- [ ] If ones particular assumption falls it can be caught up by another: If some abstract form of time isn't necessary then one can revert to theories that allow perfect symmetries of relations which are not described by computation. ...etc. How would one invalidate the whole thing?  - safety mechanism for tests - or at least, that would be assumed
	  - [ ] Try limitation on hardcoded relationships between things: Visual representations, symmetries of them etc..  
	  - [ ] Testing/Simulating with fewer resources, see how that impacts behavior; temporal/visual/... (Modeling resources?)
	  - [ ] Not having access to inner perceived structure (transduction/..)/equivalency rules  
- [ ] Keep pulsing certain directionalitiws for changes in sone "does it continue", agift behavior based on such changes
- [ ] Proved in some finite space as opposed to general one.  
- [ ] Dangers of simulating ignorances (removing certain inhibitions; (same for safety constraints in some sense..))
- [ ] 'Monkey testing':/.../fuzzing Random changing values/random forgetting: Simulating, what would happen?
