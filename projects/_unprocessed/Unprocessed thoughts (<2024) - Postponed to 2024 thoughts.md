###### Specific implementation questions/constraints
- [ ] **direction at the point**: What does it mean for a point yo become its own direction? ; shift in d
	- [ ] The morphism is inconsistently a point across itself ?
	- [ ] I suspect the source of a great many human confusions would be the interpretation of the direction at the point, while simultaneously not being aware of that that's what abstractly been done.
	- [ ] direction as point think, as a confusion: The result and the processof getting there often confused or often ambiguous in language? ; Nearly, ..
- [ ] **zero**: Generalization of zero st the split point between opposite directionalities?  
	- [ ] 'zero' where distinguishability begins for some modular structure
	- [ ] **ALL vs one**: Still how to differentiate between ALL as opposed to just some matching pattern. Just some boundary condition of there being no X with property larger? - That certainly wont work arbitrarily
	- [ ] "ZERO" IS the terminal?!!! - it's on the edge, not the point, or if zero from a seleciton, then it's apoint
	- [ ] zero ary (zero input) choosing an element from the set - carlos - It's more genwral of some cross of the frame as the selextion/permutation of the encoding, how is this generalized, external inconsostency? realized by some non ignorant atep? - As a way of saying that the selection is ignorant
- [ ] **If unknown**, Practical guesses if the answer is unkown to trigger a response which will make a subsequent guess more accurate/correct-
