###### Specific implementation questions/constraints

- [ ] **zero**: Generalization of zero st the split point between opposite directionalities?  
	- [ ] 'zero' where distinguishability begins for some modular structure
	- [ ] **ALL vs one**: Still how to differentiate between ALL as opposed to just some matching pattern. Just some boundary condition of there being no X with property larger? - That certainly wont work arbitrarily
	- [ ] "ZERO" IS the terminal?!!! - it's on the edge, not the point, or if zero from a seleciton, then it's apoint
	- [ ] zero ary (zero input) choosing an element from the set - carlos - It's more genwral of some cross of the frame as the selextion/permutation of the encoding, how is this generalized, external inconsostency? realized by some non ignorant atep? - As a way of saying that the selection is ignorant
