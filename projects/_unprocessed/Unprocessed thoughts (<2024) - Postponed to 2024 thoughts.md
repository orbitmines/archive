##### Superpose in more detail
  
- [ ] On 3-line, We could also do the interesting thing, of then taking the two existing lines which define a continuation, and connecting those together.

Not so sure about these points:
- [ ] Rewrite rules, accidently hitting some "speed up?":: Hence time/inconsistency/motion/acceleration could be conceptualized as some unmatched pattern/relation (where unmatched is no link to some frame) looking for something to latch onto, and usually it's the next one in some directionality, other tumes the skipped a few in that directionality or something completely different - though abstractly if course this would be generalized as its own directionality so this differentiation only makes sense in relation to something else. - What happens if you apply this quantum mechanically/or multicomputationally?  

- [ ] Matching to any part of some dorectionality in the following sense. One upper smaller one (saw two things), one larger one say three things. The lower one corresponding to normal movement, the other to higher level movement of say Ctrl+Move, similar to word movement using the keyboard. Then the points as an abstract pattern being able to match to any part of the directionality, as long as they're in succession, as long as they're three.

- [ ] Everything is connected to everything, inconsistent, and want to drop the edges. Actuall ignorant abstraction layer above it, with the disguinsihability with additional information. It's the edges with allow for differentiability. Triangle, point sbove it, ignorant connections. Symmetry, things allow for distinguishability is the memory of having rotated (disallow access, disallow the memory/conenction) ; Always additional structure to it is what defines the abstraction.

The abstract idea of persistence is quite straight-forward:  non-trivially limits access to the previous 'steps'.

Ignoring Redundancies (; Skipping Equivalences)
Ignorant of its use - visualizing
###### Specific implementation questions/constraints
- [ ] **direction at the point**: What does it mean for a point yo become its own direction? 
	- [ ] The morphism is inconsistently a point across itself ?
	- [ ] I suspect the source of a great many human confusions would be the interpretation of the direction at the point, while simultaneously not being aware of that that's what abstractly been done.
	- [ ] direction as point think, as a confusion: The result and the processof getting there often confused or often ambiguous in language? ; Nearly, ..
- [ ] **zero**: Generalization of zero st the split point between opposite directionalities?  
	- [ ] 'zero' where distinguishability begins for some modular structure
	- [ ] **ALL vs one**: Still how to differentiate between ALL as opposed to just some matching pattern. Just some boundary condition of there being no X with property larger? - That certainly wont work arbitrarily
	- [ ] "ZERO" IS the terminal?!!! - it's on the edge, not the point, or if zero from a seleciton, then it's apoint
	- [ ] zero ary (zero input) choosing an element from the set - carlos - It's more genwral of some cross of the frame as the selextion/permutation of the encoding, how is this generalized, external inconsostency? realized by some non ignorant atep? - As a way of saying that the selection is ignorant
- [ ] **If unknown**, Practical guesses if the answer is unkown to trigger a response which will make a subsequent guess more accurate/correct- 
- [ ] Jump to extremes *assumed end

# Implementation
- Locally defined rewrite rules?

- [ ] In reference to the idea of not having access to the details of what some point is, then gaining them, there is an ambiguity on where exactly one mentions the structure ; say not having access to a binary sequence, so having merely a point to reference the entire thing, and then gaining access at that point, which then holds the ambiguity of where in that sequence, or relative character one is able to grab onto the structure. Or if the grabbing is parallelized into multiple rays, then how those are distributed themselves again, up for ambiguity.  

Partially = locally?
- [ ] Partiality/unresolved parts critical.  
	- [ ] How to define currently trying some directionality: waiting for some function, perhaps some partial state acquirable? ; parallel, one at the completion step, the other in between still waiting
		- [ ] Unknowns & inconsistencies driving curiosity?  

	- [ ] Partial reversibility critical, same for superpositions and possible spaces (close to approximates).. 
	- [ ] Unresolved as: this computation was cut off/short? Unresolved: a pointer to continue investigation? ; pointer/reference to terminal
	- [ ] Recognizing structure but not it's name (failure to find a link): Recognizing properties/context, but not some specific property/attached representation.  
	- [ ] Hooking steps of the program:  
		- [ ] Already start doing something while decision is pending - do the things which one can reverse?  
		  - [ ] This would allow for the hooking of the process by a programmer: Hey while you're still working on this thing, perhaps [some answer to some function] should be considered, what would happen then? (Basically simulating an answer by a programmer ; some arbitrary process which hooks into a function)  
	- [ ] 'Unintended'/'Unrealized' effects realized? / Resources one didn't know one is consuming etc... (unknowns)
