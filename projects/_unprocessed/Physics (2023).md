Spreads ro sll possible until another is better and the kthers contracts, adtercseeing lightning,? ; Everything is shrunk from the other side into the channel that now opens up. Entropy. ; ?
; Is lightning branching and hitting the ground phrasable as all the other branches contract back and use the branch that hit the ground? 
Probably many things you could phrase this way ðŸ¤”

High fos water dropplet bounching off water myltiple times, each time higher the smaller it is, then merging witht he water structure below, local gravitational pressure breaks and then merges partially, shockwave below- interesting

Duplicating traversing structures requires part of the topology to duplicate hence modifying it??

Formulation of "limit of causality" which could be "speed of light"; Trade-off between global movement & local movement? Propagation through space against propagation internally.

Non-locality from a direction trying to be followed on ehich there is no continuation defined. One would be, oh it's a fixed point nothing happens it stays herem The other is, it's a pattern match time, what matches this end, well anything. -???

But then, at least in the quantum mechanical case, you want to be able to interporaltw between each of the successive points and relate it to the other space. This could be quite nontrivial indeed,  
"and everything in between in relation to some other space" very similar to overlapping - how is this different from superopose?

computational effort. Unless in some extreme some local properties are entirely temporally (local) irrelevant? Doubtful? ; QUantum mechanics no cost to local equivalence of some state except the conversion in time. DIfferent approaches to the same state are locally actually perfectly the same except for potential elements; and thus future trajectory? Or is this contradictory and global state always relevant?

That twitter feed with Jonathan and Joscha bach talking about hawking radiation of blackholez, Jonathan saying that in the multiway (or quantum case) it means that branches in which the blackhole isnt formed/differently formed eventually outlive the ones that do, and that corresponding to their evaporation - if that was the case, or if this thought is indeed as interesting - what's the generalization of that? - reference in survival?

- [ ] follow up on [[Jonathan Gorard]] message;

The entropically dominant thing - what if that (or is that how) the wave function collapse thing is phrased? That once some measurement is made yhat doesn't necessarily mean that all the other branches are abandoned more that the one in which the measurement is made is entropically dominant and hence the one an observer sees. - Or something along those lines. - or apply this to other kinds

From [[Chyp (Cospans of HYPergraphs)]]'s 1st paper: "statistical perfect correlations or (GHZ-like) quantum entanglement." ; brought the thought: So it's the equivalency frame of the connections, if they are connected which means entanglement, not necessarily at the frame of the defined vertex. (Could make sense if in the case of the vertex we assume that that means merely additional constructions which should be considered - and are considered in the quantum case, but usually ignored.)

Why is quantum gravity/acceleration such a problem? Is it merely because the different casaul states aren't easily tracked of the thing that's perceived/identified as "the same" particle/structure//... (& hence hard to define what motion(/change and thus what the persisting structures are/is at that scale/level of description?)  

Again the thought of quantum entanglement being the formation of some (possibly nondestructabile - probably??) connection/relation to the frame.  

Could this jumping ahead be generealized as of some higher level of description interaction (for quantum gravity a quick search says the planck scale)

Could the mass of a blackhole or its gravitational power or m.. be caused by its rotational spin/stored in its rotational spin

COuld quantum entanglement be phrased as merely placing some relationship on some frame hence changing what that thing is necessarily?

Could you find out whether/where/... some distant place is interacting with certain things (possibly non-locally) quantum-mechanically? (does this question even make sense?) - Detect whether some place is using certain kinds of quantum mechanics?? -. ...

Think I recently wrote this already case, could wuantum mechanics of zx calculus be that the double connection break since there's in some frame perfect summetry ignore the direction to be deleted. If not, then it doesn't happen. -

[[Sean Caroll]]'s AMA - Quantum Mechanically some temperature with non-moving peieces??? - Definitely need to look into this, is it just non-local effects for taht temp, and so the local structure is not seeming to move or something like that\?

What's the continuum hypothesis? Is this just that pattern of infinity in some direction being satisfied or something? Isn't the pattern as an assumption enough or is it the pattern as an assumption is actually also consistent??

If we measure two particles in a quantum cup state with the same meadurement on both 
ends we get a classical cup, not the other way around. This might be phrased that in the direction of the equivalency, if it is the only inconsistent direction, they merge and hence get an ordinary cup. If they are not isomorphic, since for the color of the spiders the frame of each color is another binary value and thus the structures are not the same if one ignores the directionality of equivalency, they break?

This is what the fusing is, equivalency, sameness, ifnoring the inconsistent direction doing the rwuivalencing.

Might this on a small scale also work for any kind of matching pattern ignoring the equivalency directionality? Does it have to be structure preserving beyond the pattern? Perhaps both simultaneously?

Is it possible to from quantum states (entanglements), find ones which are thus causally related and have not been interfered with from which unusual patterns of measurement might detail the existence of distant civilizations which have built quantum computers?, and before building safeguards to this sort of detection can he found?

Light is massless (or perceived to be in some context, since it isnt) because it doesn't interact between timesteps?

[[2023-08-07]]
Might there be a way(likely incredibly small technology, possibly quantum mechanical), to detect how much time is passing thereby being able to account for how much divergence there is in time passed through referenced speed of the whole structure doing the counting and adjusting for it.
