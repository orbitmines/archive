A curious thought experiment one might perform is that of accessing previous states as a non-interacting observer without the need of memory - other than having to persist the particulars which would allow for this - which would require memory (; non-trivial persistence).

Conceptualize from always moving at the limit speed at every yime step, but get blocked by spatial structures conflicting

---

Is there an example of small group of cells having persisting memory to coordinate restrcuturing, or does most of the found examples favor ..

---

there must be someone who has considered and tried to find a possible warping or what one currently considers to be the known universe, as possible multiple reflections of a smaller space?

Conceptual map of explored ideas; visually show which things are related (and why) and might be interesting research topics.

An idea: Organizations looking for people, setting up qualifications/specifications/wishes/requirements and bulk-application (or an open one) by people looking for an organization, allows for more time to write one's goal.; both sides open matching

Modelling complex ecosystems:
Perhaps it's not sufficient simply to change the ecology of the planet once. Seems to me a proper system of monitoring and controlling the ecology of an entire planet would be a future solution to dynamically adjust a planet. Taking into account factors of other bodies around the earth when a change of mass has taken place or similar factors not directly relevant.

---

Perhaps some weird physicalized molecule/something which could represent such a structural component more accurately. (some speculation as how such a thing may be useful)


---

Somewhere the romantic notion that building is likely to be more complex than destroying a thing; not that destruction cannot be complex and beautiful in a certain light. (Relate this to ethics, perhaps a likely essence of it). Complex doesn't necessarily mean useful though.

On definitions: Secrets: Given the idea that one's recollection of events (memory) is imperfect, the 'keeping of secrets' is an interesting concept. If one isn't even fully able to recall one's memory, let alone that of another. A 'secret' then is the call to something the 'other person ought to know' or 'significant information', which requires the modelling of another system. Why had they 'ought to know'/'want to know'/'should know'/...?

---

On definitions: Differences/appropriateness/matters of controversy: Differences visually, are easily pointed out by the human mind, but any differences between things are worth figuring out why something is different and how that effects the world. It's not so hard to imagine that a human mind never exposed to a particular visual stimulus of other human that is notably different from one's previously seen, could merit this. What's significant is whether such differences should result into different treatment, and the psychological arguments that independent of moral claims that anything unusual (where unusual could be defined; as not having seen before from a particular observer's perspective), merits curiosity/adversity/.... With sciences in  place it is not that hard to create a link between visual differences and a biological explanation (whether finding that is trivial or non-trivial matters not for this line of reasoning). It is whether differences resulting in different observations/actions following from observations, are deemed (morally or practically) as something (a bias applied) appropriate.

Although I don't think Asimov explicitly stated it but hinted at it. The Gaian preference to use as little syllables as possible to refer to some human-as-a-component seems revealing in the sense that as little information ad possible is used as to not have to disambiguate constantly (through multiple possible reference options). Optimizing for efficiency in the sense of low information density, and computational efficiency in the sense of realizing when ambiguity will exist, and allowing for more information to be used as to not have to use computation in the form of transformations (time-efficient), but positionally encode it into the syllables & location/reference of where the information was acquired.

Thought popped up earlier today that I should get some better understanding of archaic greek. Followed by the idea that any understanding of language would necessarily be different from prior learned languages. It's seems inconceivable one would be able to understand the language properly as back when it was more frequently used. And that learning it will change the relation and understanding of other languages.

How has Wolfram Institute dealt with Observer Theory? (; something I'm basically trying to construct in some sense. I believe I mentioned an inquiry like this before.)

---

What about waves/wave-length? How does that factor in with the speed limit? ; Somehow I've not thought about this aspect yet.

---

(; 08/03/2023; late night confusion); `Zero mass implies speed limit? Wouldn't that be reframable as speed limit `

What about waves/wave-length? How does that factor in with the speed limit? ; Somehow I've not thought about this aspect yet.

h (; planck) (or smaller) being the timestep for speed limit

Speed limit (albeit light speed or its general concept whether actually attributed to light or mot); the perfect spacial propegation in some space. A quality possibly attributed to teleportation as well. Nerely perfect propegation, spacial locality is irrelevant to this property.

Isn't the more interesting question how one would slow down once a speed limit is achieved? (; start referencing it without the use of light). Through some external abnormality one might be slowed down, but if internal motion isn't propegated, when is the motion stopped? What happens for instance with light? Some knowledge gaps here to answer these questions properly.

---


As for "concious experience", mystical aspects making it harder to do anything with it. A curious question that keeps me wondering: Why the visual experience oriented one way over a perfect mirroring? The observer wouldn't know the difference of course, then what does the particular form represent? Why one over the other? - My first guess would be some ordering it what happens first, what updates first, or some boundary in the universe which says this one comes first?

Comment discord today: This would make for conceptual continuous movement usint something else in memory to destingiosh recency. ; the torus as 'continuous', additional context allowing for disambiguation of ambiguous points on the torus. Extreme signals at the end of the 2d grid seem intuitive in the sense that they'd be the least likely in the space to cause inaccuracies.

1d vs 2d? Pethaps biological practical reasons

What about the search of a star or black hole in an unusual place ? -

One tripe around the torus perhaps representing additional resource strains and hence more likely to collapse to a state of confusion?

---

It seems to be the interaction of arriving at the 'same place' through high velocity travel, where one is moving, the other, smaller, not. That the thing not moving is interpreted ss the thing moving as a possible 'cosmic ray',

... this thought is not so well formed, I'm not sure on the right language for it. Spacial abnormalities being influenced by, or through being at some 'same place' (which is merely a matter of perception, they seem equivalent), through a space. Their interaction is through propegation?

Confusion here, I need some better terms to describe these microscropic influences.

---

Are not processes different on the surface of another planet? Are not cognitive processes different on another planet? Is influence of gravitational forces enough to change the emerging layer of information processing? Could it impact lower hardware-levels to such an insignificant extent? Is not even the slightest change in speed or impulses possible which can dramatically alter outcomes?

On heat dissipation: If forms of energy are either motion or something like abnormalities which cause mass, and most theories see heat or motion as always existing as some form of waste product. Is there not a known process which turns motion into potential mass, is it not conceivable that a black hole can collapse, is it not conceivable that there might be structure inside one?

---

Biology: -omics, relevant?

Perhaps get some self-analysis going, or at least more data gathering.

As is this searching/crawling Wikipedia patterns paper able for deducing/influencing the observer, such is the subsequent searching for word meanings while reading text

Rationality sounds like irrationality, utopian sounds like distopian (; adding entry on 01/03/2023; probably a re-wording from a thought already expressed sometime next year.)

Based on the idea that anything can be framed, seemingly correctly/confincingly, as desired by the observer doing the framing. Take trees as an example. You might say, trees are beautiful and help...

Physics: Thoughts on Blackholes, having in mind how Stephen Wolfram described them: Information black holes/fixed points through time. They can merge, but that doesn't necessarily rule out that they can 'explode'/'collapse', evidently not an intuitive thing if it's never yet been observed. ; (31/03/2023; The thought occurred: What about something like properly timing the bringing together of multiple blackholes in a way that usually doesn't happen?; Can they be steered someway? Can a particular configuration result in a collapse? Is it not just the halting of any updating rules as Wolfram might suggest; but perhaps a temporally halted one in some aspect? )



---

Random idea: Given the availability of knowing where the eyes of the observer are in relation to a computer screen, couldn't one generate sequences of frame to imitate a 3D-like experience to the human without any additional aid? (Not just on the screen but imitate it being close to the human; 'as if it's between the gap of the screen and the eyes of the human', might have similar problems of motion-sickness when the eyes are moving. Curvature of the screen would also be relevant)

Qualia; perhaps just not mention this, it's a bit too abstract to properly think about, likely undecidable*


While on the bike; Likely the only way to approach such a problem is by altering one's own cognition; but that has obvious detremental consequences; and likely only possible once human cognition, or the functioning of the brain is understood. Even in the perception of framing it as a cognition to a soul, this for science means the same thing, if it can interact with the brain, it is observable and linked and might as well be a physical thing to us. Possible notion that the way /sequence of interactions is relevant for having this.
