You probably wouldn't want to normalize (ie create the pressure that you must) publishing you everything do online - but that's probably what I'm signalling to now

What di you do in a world where finding something is the hard part, then copying snd redistributing takes resources, but copying is a pretty univerdal resource. This has basically been the transition/history of software?

The difference in interpretation of 'inconsistency' in mathematical terms, and it's more usual definition of abstract change/directionality/asymmetry?
- [ ] Is this merely, within one system, there's a single inconsistency, which makes the whole thing ergodic, or is there something else?
	- [ ] It is precisely inconsistent systems which allow for ergodic exploration? - Then extact to another system to formalize



---

A curious thought experiment one might perform is that of accessing previous states as a non-interacting observer without the need of memory - other than having to persist the particulars which would allow for this - which would require memory (; non-trivial persistence).

arbitr-ary, bin-ary -- is that the same base, or is it arbit-rary, bi-nary, at least an interesting considence if not

Connection 'in and of itself'/'inherent'/... is still unanswered, this requires more knowledge of physics likely.? At least to state the more abstract things with more certainty. At least clearly, they cannot be general.?

Random thought from Tuesday while with alex&dani, more activity/relativistic/... affects differently the perception - is it conceivable that dreaming is a similar thing where in the last moment of waking up relatively all that is experienced in that instant compared to the experience of others? - Probably not the case (Alex), but it's still an interesting thought and at least generally possible maybe?

Im reminded of some idea to use the hits in something like any image/article and built from there violations ([[2023-12-07]]; as some entry into stegonography or something [[Jonathan Gorard]] called covariant computation)

Defocussed eyes seem to rrly on color to readjust? - Can focus to something with a similar color incorrectly

[[2023-10-12]]
Vission working loke this: positional encodings of the field is the same, movr away from focus, the abstraction layer on top changes (further away from focus becomes smaller number of nodes anove the positional encodingz hence perceived smaller) focus on it, mor information more jodes, more dedicated resources) - probably some oversimplification, but an easy to visualize how the positional encoding doesn't change but the description above abstractly attached to it does.

3d modulus, perhaps points arrows outward, see where it goes, is it a hypertorus, is that definition like this? Inside to inside or inside to outside?

[[2023-08-26]]
Shouldn't phrase color illusion as an illusion, better to phrase it that what color is to your mind is not just simple spectrum with some opposites. It necessarily uses context too, it is much more nontrivial. At some point the wavelengths are the same frequency. - But your mind does not interpet it like wavelengths, it is likely much more nontrivial. - Similar things said elsewhere? How to showcase this nonteiviality? - Is it a necessary aspect or is it possible to only abide by the wavelengths, and what sort of processing would one lose if it did. Because they're likely significantly different perceptions - perhaps it wouldn't look similar at all - perhaps it wouldn't functions respond similar at all. Less information, less contextual relations?

Eyes/Mind correct for predictable lines/shapes similarly..

[[2023-08-25]]
Much less stable encoding on many exploretive features of the brain? Perhaps the more primitive ones of position and colors are more fixed/stable, more easily accessible in some nontrivial way?

Conceptualize from always moving at the limit speed at every yime step, but get blocked by spatial structures conflicting

Origin of life: perhaps look in situations which aren't usual except in the formation of some planet: Highly volatile, high temperature (high differences in temperature) environments which might allow for the instantiation of some proto-life and then allow it to persist and not die instantly.

Causality as a conceptual extreme on correlation in time.,.

---

Conceptual map of explored ideas; visually show which things are related (and why) and might be interesting research topics.

An idea: Organizations looking for people, setting up qualifications/specifications/wishes/requirements and bulk-application (or an open one) by people looking for an organization, allows for more time to write one's goal.; both sides open matching

Modelling complex ecosystems:
Perhaps it's not sufficient simply to change the ecology of the planet once. Seems to me a proper system of monitoring and controlling the ecology of an entire planet would be a future solution to dynamically adjust a planet. Taking into account factors of other bodies around the earth when a change of mass has taken place or similar factors not directly relevant.

---

Perhaps some weird physicalized molecule/something which could represent such a structural component more accurately. (some speculation as how such a thing may be useful)


---

Somewhere the romantic notion that building is likely to be more complex than destroying a thing; not that destruction cannot be complex and beautiful in a certain light. (Relate this to ethics, perhaps a likely essence of it). Complex doesn't necessarily mean useful though.

---

On definitions: Secrets: Given the idea that one's recollection of events (memory) is imperfect, the 'keeping of secrets' is an interesting concept. If one isn't even fully able to recall one's memory, let alone that of another. A 'secret' then is the call to something the 'other person ought to know' or 'significant information', which requires the modelling of another system. Why had they 'ought to know'/'want to know'/'should know'/...?

---

On definitions: Differences/appropriateness/matters of controversy: Differences visually, are easily pointed out by the human mind, but any differences between things are worth figuring out why something is different and how that effects the world. It's not so hard to imagine that a human mind never exposed to a particular visual stimulus of other human that is notably different from one's previously seen, could merit this. What's significant is whether such differences should result into different treatment, and the psychological arguments that independent of moral claims that anything unusual (where unusual could be defined; as not having seen before from a particular observer's perspective), merits curiosity/adversity/.... With sciences in  place it is not that hard to create a link between visual differences and a biological explanation (whether finding that is trivial or non-trivial matters not for this line of reasoning). It is whether differences resulting in different observations/actions following from observations, are deemed (morally or practically) as something (a bias applied) appropriate.

---

Although I don't think Asimov explicitly stated it but hinted at it. The Gaian preference to use as little syllables as possible to refer to some human-as-a-component seems revealing in the sense that as little information ad possible is used as to not have to disambiguate constantly (through multiple possible reference options). Optimizing for efficiency in the sense of low information density, and computational efficiency in the sense of realizing when ambiguity will exist, and allowing for more information to be used as to not have to use computation in the form of transformations (time-efficient), but positionally encode it into the syllables & location/reference of where the information was acquired.

---

Is the spacial universe even 3-dimensional? Might as well be effectively 3-dimensional, but if what one characterizes as mass curves it, isn't that a spacial alteration and not necessarily 3-dimensional? Or am I missing something here.

---

cosmology. ; Would be interesting to try and see if there's a torus like shape of the universe? - a bssis of inquiry from ignorance

---

I wouldn't necessarily frame it as first principles. Seems likely that that promotes the line of thinking that what one has discussed are indeed the first principles and not something more permeating, excluded from those ideas, which is something to be considered. Probably a conclusion to be drawn from that, that advice is more likely to be useful when sufficiently vague. A sort of psychological manipulation: See here a vague pattern I associate with this thing, see that pattern: it means this thing.

---

Is something like PI an abstract limit of some sort of property (; resulting from abstract/generality?)

---

Perhaps it's worth reading on some linguistics as to figure out som non-trivial ways to leverage human capability to understand symbols language efficiently? (; To better compactly 'store' complex propositions.)

---

Thought popped up earlier today that I should get some better understanding of archaic greek. Followed by the idea that any understanding of language would necessarily be different from prior learned languages. It's seems inconceivable one would be able to understand the language properly as back when it was more frequently used. And that learning it will change the relation and understanding of other languages.

Lovality in quantum/classical mechanics as field theory suggesting 'far away' no obsevrations have been made that influence them directly. This merely a matter of perception? For through enough time distant interations do impact locality, albeit in a more indirect way, which one wouldn't necessarily say isn't locality.

What about waves/wave-length? How does that factor in with the speed limit? ; Somehow I've not thought about this aspect yet.

---

h (; planck) (or smaller) being the timestep for speed limit

just 'speed limit' as it discourages inquiry in its possible dissociation with light speed.

---

Speed limit (albeit light speed or its general concept whether actually attributed to light or mot); the perfect spacial propegation in some space. A quality possibly attributed to teleportation as well. Nerely perfect propegation, spacial locality is irrelevant to this property.

Isn't the more interesting question how one would slow down once a speed limit is achieved? (; start referencing it without the use of light). Through some external abnormality one might be slowed down, but if internal motion isn't propegated, when is the motion stopped? What happens for instance with light? Some knowledge gaps here to answer these questions properly.

---


As for "concious experience", mystical aspects making it harder to do anything with it. A curious question that keeps me wondering: Why the visual experience oriented one way over a perfect mirroring? The observer wouldn't know the difference of course, then what does the particular form represent? Why one over the other? - My first guess would be some ordering it what happens first, what updates first, or some boundary in the universe which says this one comes first?

---


Comment discord today: This would make for conceptual continuous movement usint something else in memory to destingiosh recency. ; the torus as 'continuous', additional context allowing for disambiguation of ambiguous points on the torus. Extreme signals at the end of the 2d grid seem intuitive in the sense that they'd be the least likely in the space to cause inaccuracies.

1d vs 2d? Pethaps biological practical reasons

What about the search of a star or black hole in an unusual place ? -

One tripe around the torus perhaps representing additional resource strains and hence more likely to collapse to a state of confusion?

---

It seems to be the interaction of arriving at the 'same place' through high velocity travel, where one is moving, the other, smaller, not. That the thing not moving is interpreted ss the thing moving as a possible 'cosmic ray',

... this thought is not so well formed, I'm not sure on the right language for it. Spacial abnormalities being influenced by, or through being at some 'same place' (which is merely a matter of perception, they seem equivalent), through a space. Their interaction is through propegation?

Confusion here, I need some better terms to describe these microscropic influences.

---

Are not processes different on the surface of another planet? Are not cognitive processes different on another planet? Is influence of gravitational forces enough to change the emerging layer of information processing? Could it impact lower hardware-levels to such an insignificant extent? Is not even the slightest change in speed or impulses possible which can dramatically alter outcomes?

On heat dissipation: If forms of energy are either motion or something like abnormalities which cause mass, and most theories see heat or motion as always existing as some form of waste product. Is there not a known process which turns motion into potential mass, is it not conceivable that a black hole can collapse, is it not conceivable that there might be structure inside one?

Biology: -omics, relevant?

Perhaps get some self-analysis going, or at least more data gathering.

Based on the idea that anything can be framed, seemingly correctly/confincingly, as desired by the observer doing the framing. Take trees as an example. You might say, trees are beautiful and help...

Physics: Thoughts on Blackholes, having in mind how Stephen Wolfram described them: Information black holes/fixed points through time. They can merge, but that doesn't necessarily rule out that they can 'explode'/'collapse', evidently not an intuitive thing if it's never yet been observed. ; (31/03/2023; The thought occurred: What about something like properly timing the bringing together of multiple blackholes in a way that usually doesn't happen?; Can they be steered someway? Can a particular configuration result in a collapse? Is it not just the halting of any updating rules as Wolfram might suggest; but perhaps a temporally halted one in some aspect? )



---

Random idea: Given the availability of knowing where the eyes of the observer are in relation to a computer screen, couldn't one generate sequences of frame to imitate a 3D-like experience to the human without any additional aid? (Not just on the screen but imitate it being close to the human; 'as if it's between the gap of the screen and the eyes of the human', might have similar problems of motion-sickness when the eyes are moving. Curvature of the screen would also be relevant)

---

Qualia; perhaps just not mention this, it's a bit too abstract to properly think about, likely undecidable*


While on the bike; Likely the only way to approach such a problem is by altering one's own cognition; but that has obvious detremental consequences; and likely only possible once human cognition, or the functioning of the brain is understood. Even in the perception of framing it as a cognition to a soul, this for science means the same thing, if it can interact with the brain, it is observable and linked and might as well be a physical thing to us. Possible notion that the way /sequence of interactions is relevant for having this.
