A curious thought experiment one might perform is that of accessing previous states as a non-interacting observer without the need of memory - other than having to persist the particulars which would allow for this - which would require memory (; non-trivial persistence).

On definitions: Differences/appropriateness/matters of controversy: Differences visually, are easily pointed out by the human mind, but any differences between things are worth figuring out why something is different and how that effects the world. It's not so hard to imagine that a human mind never exposed to a particular visual stimulus of other human that is notably different from one's previously seen, could merit this. What's significant is whether such differences should result into different treatment, and the psychological arguments that independent of moral claims that anything unusual (where unusual could be defined; as not having seen before from a particular observer's perspective), merits curiosity/adversity/.... With sciences in  place it is not that hard to create a link between visual differences and a biological explanation (whether finding that is trivial or non-trivial matters not for this line of reasoning). It is whether differences resulting in different observations/actions following from observations, are deemed (morally or practically) as something (a bias applied) appropriate.

Although I don't think Asimov explicitly stated it but hinted at it. The Gaian preference to use as little syllables as possible to refer to some human-as-a-component seems revealing in the sense that as little information ad possible is used as to not have to disambiguate constantly (through multiple possible reference options). Optimizing for efficiency in the sense of low information density, and computational efficiency in the sense of realizing when ambiguity will exist, and allowing for more information to be used as to not have to use computation in the form of transformations (time-efficient), but positionally encode it into the syllables & location/reference of where the information was acquired.

Thought popped up earlier today that I should get some better understanding of archaic greek. Followed by the idea that any understanding of language would necessarily be different from prior learned languages. It's seems inconceivable one would be able to understand the language properly as back when it was more frequently used. And that learning it will change the relation and understanding of other languages.

What about waves/wave-length? How does that factor in with the speed limit? ; Somehow I've not thought about this aspect yet.

(; 08/03/2023; late night confusion); `Zero mass implies speed limit? Wouldn't that be reframable as speed limit `

h (; planck) (or smaller) being the timestep for speed limit

Speed limit (albeit light speed or its general concept whether actually attributed to light or mot); the perfect spacial propegation in some space. A quality possibly attributed to teleportation as well. Nerely perfect propegation, spacial locality is irrelevant to this property.

Isn't the more interesting question how one would slow down once a speed limit is achieved? (; start referencing it without the use of light). Through some external abnormality one might be slowed down, but if internal motion isn't propegated, when is the motion stopped? What happens for instance with light? Some knowledge gaps here to answer these questions properly.

As for "concious experience", mystical aspects making it harder to do anything with it. A curious question that keeps me wondering: Why the visual experience oriented one way over a perfect mirroring? The observer wouldn't know the difference of course, then what does the particular form represent? Why one over the other? - My first guess would be some ordering it what happens first, what updates first, or some boundary in the universe which says this one comes first?

Comment discord today: This would make for conceptual continuous movement usint something else in memory to destingiosh recency. ; the torus as 'continuous', additional context allowing for disambiguation of ambiguous points on the torus. Extreme signals at the end of the 2d grid seem intuitive in the sense that they'd be the least likely in the space to cause inaccuracies.

1d vs 2d? Pethaps biological practical reasons

What about the search of a star or black hole in an unusual place ? -

One tripe around the torus perhaps representing additional resource strains and hence more likely to collapse to a state of confusion?

It seems to be the interaction of arriving at the 'same place' through high velocity travel, where one is moving, the other, smaller, not. That the thing not moving is interpreted ss the thing moving as a possible 'cosmic ray',

... this thought is not so well formed, I'm not sure on the right language for it. Spacial abnormalities being influenced by, or through being at some 'same place' (which is merely a matter of perception, they seem equivalent), through a space. Their interaction is through propegation?

Confusion here, I need some better terms to describe these microscropic influences.
