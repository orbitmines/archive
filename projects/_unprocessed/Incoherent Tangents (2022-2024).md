  - vs. "false memory"/I can still make that conclusion even though my mechanism of getting there isn't accurate.  (possibly not really, just for inaccurate reasons possibly (in)accurate) memory of loop having happened some number of times "

A curious thought experiment one might perform is that of accessing previous states as a non-interacting observer without the need of memory - other than having to persist the particulars which would allow for this - which would require memory (; non-trivial persistence).

Comment discord today: This would make for conceptual continuous movement usint something else in memory to destingiosh recency. ; the torus as 'continuous', additional context allowing for disambiguation of ambiguous points on the torus. Extreme signals at the end of the 2d grid seem intuitive in the sense that they'd be the least likely in the space to cause inaccuracies.

1d vs 2d? Pethaps biological practical reasons

What about the search of a star or black hole in an unusual place ? -

One tripe around the torus perhaps representing additional resource strains and hence more likely to collapse to a state of confusion?

It seems to be the interaction of arriving at the 'same place' through high velocity travel, where one is moving, the other, smaller, not. That the thing not moving is interpreted ss the thing moving as a possible 'cosmic ray',

... this thought is not so well formed, I'm not sure on the right language for it. Spacial abnormalities being influenced by, or through being at some 'same place' (which is merely a matter of perception, they seem equivalent), through a space. Their interaction is through propegation?

Confusion here, I need some better terms to describe these microscropic influences.
