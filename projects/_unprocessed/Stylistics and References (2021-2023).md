Define/describe a good way of phrasing the ignorance of descriptions in such a way that it's not derogatory but always useful in certsin ways - it's always the evolutionary trade off/difference in what one can see with certain ideas and what one can't/is less able to - this probably important for the presentation of the idea as the not trigger justified backlash against its phrasings. - Though I like and think it might be prudent to do use the word ignorance (I believe quantum physics has also set some precedent for this - see how it's used and if that's sufficient for this - or perhaps even interferes with how I'm describing it.(

## (non-)determinism


Might it similar to (non)determinism not make sense to asl whether it's really inconsistent or not? - I think perhaps this might be the origin of the generwlity srgument and hence also aplicable here.  
  
It's not generally (non-/)deterministic - it's directional, both of them, and necessarily directionally (in-/)consistent.

## Mathematics

I'm quite certain that it's a mistake to use language in mathematics like "there exists" and "for all" - I suspect that these only aid in confusions?

Consistency in mathematics is nothing but the assumption of consistency in the temporal direction, when that direction and inconsistent aspects are ignored? (Similarly for the opposite of inconsistency) ; generalization is necessarily inconsistent?

Mathematics assumes no timestemp, or in one timestep access to all proofs? - This can nonetheless be modlled both in none/one timestep. (none being an ignorant timestep.)

I suspect that the issue of consistency in mathematics arises from its generalization. That some inconsistency is somewhat short of a death sentence of the theory. (Better phrased than that ---) The more interesting thing to realize is, what if it's only inconsistent in very unordinary circumstances? It seems perfectly stable as an orbit and then suddenly - it is not. Hence not generally some inconsistency like `2+2=5`, but merely that a particular set of processes assume/realize that, and it's non-trivial to say what its consequences are.

Possible rephrasing as best entropy/kolgomorovcomplexity, in finding a structure which expresses 'perfect use' of (probabalistic) space, by a symmetry between symbol frequency and number of symbols.  
  
Just as boolean algebra can't reach every possible state in its abstract definition, yet not when expressed in larger terms of every possible binary sequence, so can some abstract representation in the forms of how it is physically implemented, not necessarily represent every possible universe-state.

  - "Processes do not limit the number of connections that can be made at a given interaction point." ; Similar to my assessment, not necessarily indicating one's that are not perceived by the system itself.  
  - "But interaction points allow interference (i.e. interaction). For the synthesis of compact, minimal and compositional systems, the ability to restrict interference is crucial. Hiding operations allow control of the connections made between interaction points when composing agents in parallel" ; Very close to a definition of ignorance.  
  - "Generally, processes are considered to be the same if no context, that is other processes running in parallel, can detect a difference. Unfortunately, making this intuition precise is subtle and mostly yields unwieldy characterisations of equality (which in most cases must also be undecidable, as a consequence of the halting problem)" ; very close to my assessments; I'd also conclude from that, that it's the act of ignoring certain differences which makes this possible: Neither system is 'perfectly' the same, abstractly.

I guess a little related to the descriptions can't possibly be the actual truth and are in that sense a deflation of unknowable states of the universe. ; Hence a little related to the ideas of an outside observer in the following sense: 'disquotational theory of truth' as extremes on belief as truth, where truth in the sense of belief would be 'observer-dependant'. ; Probably just more related to confusion resulting from extremes.  
- [Correspondence theory of truth](read/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth.pdf) ; More confusion similar to the previous item.

Makes mention of Bell's inequality. Quite similar to some ideas I've been having. The skeptical section is interesting. I believe I made a similar assertion about my own ideas in the sense that the best argument against it is that it's always correct in some sense. Where I'd diverge int he skeptical argument that it's unknowable whether breaking through that unknown layer is possible or not: hence exploration. And it'd be true some forms would not be knowably correct, but there are variants where this might be the case. But self-referentially, perhaps similar claims of unknowability would be applicable to the layer 'outside' of the system. ; One can re-conceptualize the two systems as being one system. Interesting, probably return to this later. Perhaps one should apply an argument to this in the form of accidentally making the 'right conclusion for conceivably accidental reasons (accidental being only held up in a certain frame of reference similar to arbitrary/infinity/..)'. This initially wrong jump might lead to investigation with could help one determine something like this. ; "It is therefore too powerful an argument to have any significance in the philosophy of science, since it does not cast doubt uniquely on conjectured unobservables." seems like an argument I need to address for my ideas. ; Perhaps in the sense of 'knowing some property applicable everywhere is useful, since it gives one a language to talk about it instead of being ignorant of it'. Or perhaps something else.  ([[Rosemary Braun]] made mention of this concept in the [[Sean Caroll]] podcast ; this intuition may me quite generalizable - that of course graining necessarily, and being quite explicit about that - 'wiring diagrams')
  
---  
  
Before reading the Maxwell's section Wolfram is referring to: A likely conclusion (although just as unprovable for now), is that perhaps the environments allow observers to manipulate the system in such a way that 'more random' of entropy increases are in some way limited. (; I believe I made a similar conjecture some time ago.) After first paragraph; and perhaps also related to a comment I made recently about conceptual uncertainty; magic/irreducibility/unintelligibility or simply a misunderstanding, how would one know?; Eventually any conceptualization must be able to be conceptualized as the same system; relevant to that description I gave to Niels?; 'communication without separation'.  
  
... 'fundamental features - like computational boundedness - ' ; I'd characterize this as an assumption or something that seems to be the case.  
  
Heat Death of the Universe section .. before reading; reminds me of some incoherent thought I had a little bit ago; perhaps black holes would represent a solution there if not the thing mentioned above. (would imply a possibly much older universe where perhaps information in a slight way is concervered from its 'previous iteration'; but quite speculativr with much ignorance on my end.)  
  
While reading the mechanoidal phase bit: Is it not the second law that could be equated to statistical analysis & probabilities, and this phase that is low-probability but highly capable organization? - An analogy like this has been in my mind for a while. Probabilities are useful descriptions, but it's merely a language. / Perhaps frame this as a much more potent problem in 'observer theory', their complexities are even harder to predict and as a language, hence pretty much technology. Be able to use the black box as a tool, be able to recognize that one might be able to look inside or probe its characteristics, be able to reconstruct its workings through some other tool ...

Read: [Toroidal topology of population activity in (2022)](./read/s41586-021-04268-7.pdf) ; The abstract hints to: "an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN", which seems a similar statement to my thought expressed in the MLST discord 2 days ago, if this expectation is indeed so obvious I could point it out without knowing much about these networks. ; further inquiry of CANs and neuroscience is probably a good idea. ; skimmed through some parts.  
  
At the same time the discussion mentions: "as 2D space is not characterized by toroidal topology"; which seems like I'm either misinterpreting some points here, or the answer above is a likely direction to which this answer will point. 2D bounded space is close to toroidal topology. (; they do mention ring & torus in respect to 1d/2d earlier)  
  
"uniform manifold approximation and projection" ?
