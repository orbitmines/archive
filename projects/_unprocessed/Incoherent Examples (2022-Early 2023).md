 The nonabsoluteness of time could also be defined as saying it is absolute in the sense of described earlier, but one would've meant by that that all perception of certain specific phenomenon are the same - those could clearly not be, but then they still change and hence you would be able to say thatm It's just that the definition of the realization of certain kinds of information isnt. It hasn't propegated yet.

Examples of directionalities:  
  
- [ ] General case of minimizing some directionality  
  of which temporal could be one ; applied functions/rules/.. .  
- [ ] Compressing/minimizing ambiguity  
  Priority: GIven all these ambiguities prefer definitions, or going to definitions with less confusion/less ambiguity. With the  
  added note, reasoned through 'anything can be interpreted as anything' notice the extremes, that it's not perfect. But  
  given the known descriptions, this seems least-confusing. (; could also be retrieved by sufficient differences in surrounding context)  
- [ ] Compressing/minimizing some level of description  
  Priorty: Least visual information / least complex descriptions: ((A.B).=)(C) -> A.B = C as an example. "There's no need for all this noise."  
  less redundancy in rules (distance in discoverability)  
- [ ] Exploration? - unknowns (Checking workings of functions under conditions, checking workings of functions if unknown ... fidelity ..)  
  Priority: Exploration of LHS -> RHS. (generic transformation; function exploration, lhs into rhs)

Distant lights across the field at dark in the evening - through a wet glass are incredibly sensitive to my movements, or temporal movements of the planet/the processing of my mind, inducing a kind of flickering where the light came from. Perceived fast switching between states since no further structure/reducibility is in my brain to account for a larger vision field and coarsegraining is easily changed. - Something along these lines?

When one uses a concept like autonomous, its more like 'non human autonomous - the human doesn't need to', but again, not autonomous in every directionality, and the human itself also has a possible automoous directionality on it.

### Incoherent Examples

As a coy introduction (in Hofstadter fashion), perhaps:
> Is this pen equal to that pen? - Frowned looks -. Ok then, let me simplify the question. Is this pen equal this pen (pointing once again, at the same pen). - Frowning having increased to unprecedented levels -. Surely, a question the philosophers have answered across all human cultures and times. It's obvious, they're equal! No, you must be wrong, it's obvious they're not! Curious bystanders continuing the now precedented ritual of frowning.

I mentioned computer science as the branch which one could perceive from which all other sciences branch, but probably more proper would be to say that it's a reference frame: Any science as some base for primary understanding could be placed in that role as long as it has the capacity to interpret all the others to a certain extent. It just so happens that computation is a convenient language to understand. ; generalize into priors?

; Within the assumptions something like this; it's likely that any possible language / distinct scientific field, can formulate any other, or encapsulate any other possible theory as an extension of its own, or perceived 'sub-field'. The actual distinction is therefore mainly important/relevant in how it changes the observer's perspective on them. Not necessarily defining a sort of generality or 'true upper-level hierarchy' from which the fields/subfields span.

---

A note to ignore some part, is only of cognitive significance, if the imagined observer doesn't properly forget its mentioning; and why should it be ignorant to temporally relevant information? Certainly something perfectly ignorant is conceivable in this particular example, but it would certainly be unusual in some sense.

---

Allow for generation of any html/js; this would possibly allow for the system to escape the browser environment, and no guarantees are made for this dangerous proposition. (; tackle this in another way)
; a slight analogy to evolutionary biology might be made here

It boils down to the idea, that the models of computation (like Kind & HVM), are subject to arbitrarily unknown/unknowable properties of the 'hardware' they are running on. And an observer, like a human, is able to be surprised when something previously thought to be deterministic, suddenly seems not to be; or is not coherent with its model. (whether that observation is actually true or not)

But think of some property like 'commutation' being falsified in a specific context of a program, and having the runtime adjust its reductions based on such information.

Use the story of branch-prediction? Some level of description says if .. then ..., branch prediction subsides that for increased speed. Or if one uses some form of probabilities/other calculation to make the decision. --> It matters how one 'evaluates every (relevant) scenery', it can be influenced by something arbitrarily unknown.

Read: [General Intelligence Requires Rethinking Exploration (2022)](2211.07819.pdf) Aleatoric uncertainty / Epistemic uncertainty / Irreducible uncertainty ; explore these? ; or perhaps both are already captured in the vagueness of the 'conceptual uncertainty' idea.

hardware being the linux_64 or its lower level, possible reduction to tet at its hardware; sime physical process, is not accessible/reducible directly through the spec. (Indirect strategies would be required) But things could be assumed or guessed at which one can say about that underlying spec, and that it might be implemented differently and each implementation having different unknowns/ uncertainty.... etc

If one would note one thing from deterministic systems is that complex behavior does not need non-determinism. (? -> Response to this would be what?)

More practical argument for privacy being perhaps an element of non-conformity in the sense of less connectivity to a larger network, therefore perhaps in certain cases more resilient to something like memetics. Although probably the reverse is likely relevant as well.; A quick thought as a possible conjecture on where Foundation and Earth might lead after reading its first chapter; besides the temporal differences already noted by Asimov as an argument.

Surely you would say the air around you is having an influence on you? And arguably a good one for I doubt your body would stay in one place without the pressure of the air.

(false analogy, seen in Foundation and Earth, brought this to mind:)
Notably which name is chosen/which analogy is chosen is relevant to the interpreter since things are interpreted differently. Any analogy is a 'false analogy' in some sense, it's whether the falseness/incorrectness/imperfectness of the analogy has significant consequences to the interpreter/observer. (Non-trivial/temporal/hinders the exploration of some perceived truth by another observer)

---

Machines aren't necessarily built to persist themselves through time, one could formulate this by saying they are ignorant of doing so. Arguably this is likely to change with better understanding of biology/robotics ; or more concretely physical manueverability & persistence. ; Reference to its dangers, as an example Jeff Hawkins concerns of reproducibility.

---

As a response to: 'But falsehoods device constant effort.' - What is the use of known truths if it is not for the effort required for a somewhat reliable memory? - Perhaps of some truths it can be said that their re-acquirement is of relative ease. Some, especially historical ones, in the absence of a scope which reveals previous states in the universe other than internalized memory, this is perhaps a more complex issue. Some similar argument could perhaps also be made of falsehoods. What of the lens? Is it not merely a perceived form of memory? How is it less faulty?

---

Similarly, while a human may not have direct access to the exact implementation and structures of their brain internally, something like that is more easily achieved within a computer. And similarly that also has its limitations in the form of computational boundedness and the psychical implementations (and their consistency through time). ;

Are you so ignorant (perhaps this is a little too harsh, but fixes the stress on this point I suppose) that perhaps understanding how the dealer shuffles the cards has not the possibility of a probabilistic edge, since it is of probabilities we speak? If you have not the guarantee of perceived fairness in the probabilities associated with the cards? Or is it merely than you cannot perceive other observers playing at the table to have devised a technique of picking up the slightest of photons as to have a probabilistic edge on the cards of others at the table?

After hearing the term (non-)hollonomic at Delft TU, a quick look at its definition, I reframed it as the idea that all systems are non-hollonomic (in my framework; although I didn't make this part of the assertion yesterday), except perhaps the universe itself. Or simply saying all systems are (non-)hollonomic, and ignorance makes them hollonomic, or one could make the argument that magic allows for either; Having said yesterday: "So, all dystems are non-hollonomic or magic"

I'd argue that additional information is added to the sentence and thus possible leads to different conclusions dependent on the observer. Where in the case of humans these might be the case. I guess a little related to the descriptions can't possibly be the actual truth and are in that sense a deflation of unknowable states of the universe. ; Hence a little related to the ideas of an outside observer in the following sense: 'disquotational theory of truth' as extremes on belief as truth, where truth in the sense of belief would be 'observer-dependant'. ; Probably just more related to confusion resulting from extremes.  
- [Correspondence theory of truth](read/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth.pdf) ; More confusion similar to the previous item. The relationship between conclusions 'an outside observer' might be able to draw, and the 'observer within the system'. In describing the relation of perceived truth and actual truth. More of the same thing analogous to: 'If an observer cannot tell they are hallucinating, they will not know so.'.  
- [Coherence theory of truth](read/wiki/Coherence_theory_of_truth.pdf) ; Coherence conflicting with dynamics? ; Makes me think a little about the idea that any assertion should be considered within the context of the information used to make the assertion. Or at least, it would be likely useful to do so.  
- [Confirmation holism](read/wiki/Confirmation_holism.pdf) ; Interesting, more inquiry here at some point.  
- [Underdetermination](read/wiki/Underdetermination.pdf); Simiarly any definition of a system can be abstractly attributed to some other system it's operating under which could undermine the observer entirely with sufficient control. Makes mention of Bell's inequality. Quite similar to some ideas I've been having. The skeptical section is interesting. I believe I made a similar assertion about my own ideas in the sense that the best argument against it is that it's always correct in some sense. Where I'd diverge int he skeptical argument that it's unknowable whether breaking through that unknown layer is possible or not: hence exploration. And it'd be true some forms would not be knowably correct, but there are variants where this might be the case. But self-referentially, perhaps similar claims of unknowability would be applicable to the layer 'outside' of the system. ; One can re-conceptualize the two systems as being one system. Interesting, probably return to this later. Perhaps one should apply an argument to this in the form of accidentally making the 'right conclusion for conceivably accidental reasons (accidental being only held up in a certain frame of reference similar to arbitrary/infinity/..)'. This initially wrong jump might lead to investigation with could help one determine something like this. ; "It is therefore too powerful an argument to have any significance in the philosophy of science, since it does not cast doubt uniquely on conjectured unobservables." seems like an argument I need to address for my ideas. ; Perhaps in the sense of 'knowing some property applicable everywhere is useful, since it gives one a language to talk about it instead of being ignorant of it'. Or perhaps something else.  ([[Rosemary Braun]] made mention of this concept in the [[Sean Caroll]] podcast ; this intuition may me quite generalizable - that of course graining necessarily, and being quite explicit about that - 'wiring diagrams')
