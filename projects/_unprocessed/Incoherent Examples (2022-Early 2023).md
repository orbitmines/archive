 The nonabsoluteness of time could also be defined as saying it is absolute in the sense of described earlier, but one would've meant by that that all perception of certain specific phenomenon are the same - those could clearly not be, but then they still change and hence you would be able to say thatm It's just that the definition of the realization of certain kinds of information isnt. It hasn't propegated yet.

- universality makes assumptions of temporal stability? 
	- COmputationality/Universal computatinally equivalent in the sense that its abstraction ignores certain practicalities such as temporal factors ... but could in some way hold up in some infinite directionaly were certain assumptions to hold.

- [ ] On the sara walker simplifying complexity on time episode: It's not that "it can't happen by random chance" it's that there are two different levels of description to describe thexpoe same thing. One is without information of structures which produce the random things, the other, is "not"/less. More structure which also moght arbitrarily be coarsegrainrd, inaccurate, or with its quircks  
	- [ ] It should be: not generallt linear, but ina. particular persoective, or on a level of description it's linear. Log-ed exponential function being linear at that different level of description: coald be seen as a different corase graining, hence both not generally linear, but only if tou look at it in a particular way

History: The initial side of the perceived non-trivial temporal directionality. Relying on some non-trivial consistency (; temporal invariance), in order to tell the story (; or be able to recover parts) of that initial side.

Examples of directionalities:  
  
- [ ] Compressing/minimizing ambiguity  
  Priority: GIven all these ambiguities prefer definitions, or going to definitions with less confusion/less ambiguity. With the  
  added note, reasoned through 'anything can be interpreted as anything' notice the extremes, that it's not perfect. But  
  given the known descriptions, this seems least-confusing. (; could also be retrieved by sufficient differences in surrounding context)  
- [ ] Exploration? - unknowns (Checking workings of functions under conditions, checking workings of functions if unknown ... fidelity ..)

Read: [General Intelligence Requires Rethinking Exploration (2022)](2211.07819.pdf) Aleatoric uncertainty / Epistemic uncertainty / Irreducible uncertainty ; explore these? ; or perhaps both are already captured in the vagueness of the 'conceptual uncertainty' idea.

Possible rephrasing as best entropy/kolgomorovcomplexity, in finding a structure which expresses 'perfect use' of (probabalistic) space, by a symmetry between symbol frequency and number of symbols. 

I suspect there to be some deep (a)symmetries between the certain conceptualizations of 'zero' and 'one'. ... For the conceptualization of zero requires some non-zero directionality. (; To have the ability to describe invariance, one needs some variance.)

In diametrical contrast, in the case of quantum physics, the theorems of Kochen and Specker,[5] the inequalities of John Bell,[6] and experimental evidence of Alain Aspect,[7][8] all indicate that quantum randomness does not stem from any such physical information." ; This latter part is resultant from the idea that we seemingly can't obtain such information according to quantum mechanics right?

  - "In some process calculi (notably the π-calculus) channels themselves can be sent in messages through (other) channels, allowing the topology of process interconnections to change. Some process calculi also allow channels to be created during the execution of a computation." This part seems critical, further inquiry... ; self-referentialness there  
  - "Processes do not limit the number of connections that can be made at a given interaction point." ; Similar to my assessment, not necessarily indicating one's that are not perceived by the system itself.  
  - "But interaction points allow interference (i.e. interaction). For the synthesis of compact, minimal and compositional systems, the ability to restrict interference is crucial. Hiding operations allow control of the connections made between interaction points when composing agents in parallel" ; Very close to a definition of ignorance.  
  - "Generally, processes are considered to be the same if no context, that is other processes running in parallel, can detect a difference. Unfortunately, making this intuition precise is subtle and mostly yields unwieldy characterisations of equality (which in most cases must also be undecidable, as a consequence of the halting problem)" ; very close to my assessments; I'd also conclude from that, that it's the act of ignoring certain differences which makes this possible: Neither system is 'perfectly' the same, abstractly.

- [Dialetheism](read/wiki/Dialetheism.pdf) ; As I promptly (accidentally) worded before reading it by 'translating' the greek word (without making the direct link yet) ; This seems to be reasoning by superposition, and the superficial summaries of some of its criticisms already seem to mention that this does not remove self-reference.  
- [Absoluteness](read/wiki/Absoluteness.pdf) ; Probably a good idea to make a more formal dive into the mathematics behind set/group/... theory, and see how they would relate to the more abstract 'observer/ignorant' thing I'm trying to realize.  
- [Deflationary theory of truth](read/wiki/Deflationary_theory_of_truth.pdf) ; Don't know necessarily what to say about this. Seems more of a case study of particulars of the human mind and its languages. I'd argue that additional information is added to the sentence and thus possible leads to different conclusions dependent on the observer. Where in the case of humans these might be the case. I guess a little related to the descriptions can't possibly be the actual truth and are in that sense a deflation of unknowable states of the universe. ; Hence a little related to the ideas of an outside observer in the following sense: 'disquotational theory of truth' as extremes on belief as truth, where truth in the sense of belief would be 'observer-dependant'. ; Probably just more related to confusion resulting from extremes.  
- [Correspondence theory of truth](read/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth.pdf) ; More confusion similar to the previous item. The relationship between conclusions 'an outside observer' might be able to draw, and the 'observer within the system'. In describing the relation of perceived truth and actual truth. More of the same thing analogous to: 'If an observer cannot tell they are hallucinating, they will not know so.'.  
- [Coherence theory of truth](read/wiki/Coherence_theory_of_truth.pdf) ; Coherence conflicting with dynamics? ; Makes me think a little about the idea that any assertion should be considered within the context of the information used to make the assertion. Or at least, it would be likely useful to do so.  
- [Confirmation holism](read/wiki/Confirmation_holism.pdf) ; Interesting, more inquiry here at some point.  
- [Underdetermination](read/wiki/Underdetermination.pdf); Simiarly any definition of a system can be abstractly attributed to some other system it's operating under which could undermine the observer entirely with sufficient control. Makes mention of Bell's inequality. Quite similar to some ideas I've been having. The skeptical section is interesting. I believe I made a similar assertion about my own ideas in the sense that the best argument against it is that it's always correct in some sense. Where I'd diverge int he skeptical argument that it's unknowable whether breaking through that unknown layer is possible or not: hence exploration. And it'd be true some forms would not be knowably correct, but there are variants where this might be the case. But self-referentially, perhaps similar claims of unknowability would be applicable to the layer 'outside' of the system. ; One can re-conceptualize the two systems as being one system. Interesting, probably return to this later. Perhaps one should apply an argument to this in the form of accidentally making the 'right conclusion for conceivably accidental reasons (accidental being only held up in a certain frame of reference similar to arbitrary/infinity/..)'. This initially wrong jump might lead to investigation with could help one determine something like this. ; "It is therefore too powerful an argument to have any significance in the philosophy of science, since it does not cast doubt uniquely on conjectured unobservables." seems like an argument I need to address for my ideas. ; Perhaps in the sense of 'knowing some property applicable everywhere is useful, since it gives one a language to talk about it instead of being ignorant of it'. Or perhaps something else.  ([[Rosemary Braun]] made mention of this concept in the [[Sean Caroll]] podcast ; this intuition may me quite generalizable - that of course graining necessarily, and being quite explicit about that - 'wiring diagrams')
