This means better infrastructure for dissemblers

Arguably the goal of OrbitMines is to bridge the gap between languages, interfaces and videogames. A world in which learning, science, ..., engineering are all an exploratory game.  
  
github embed

Many of these steps are still quite uncertain, but the direction is clear.  
  
All ongoing projects in a single overview.  
  
  
percolation  
  
back and forth of anything, what bunss to what that way just one direction or many

This is a live document generates from here

Don't expect people to navigate the site, just assume people are not explorative enough to do that, and put all the shit of the entire project on a single page  
  
Don't expect people to understand the scope pf the project I'm not searching I've found the damn thing and now it's implementation time  
  
Intermediate projects for funding  
other ways of funding  
  
archive, discord github issues  
  
  
People don't reach out if you're reading this, and find it interesting please do reach out on : discord etc.. I'm always curious as to your projects or why this peaks your interest  
  
This project needs funding, or reach me at:  
  
  
email all people who's work I've read?  
email all ??, head of programming  
email unis  
email profs  
email idfk  
email nlnet again, f  
erc, all funds, game stupid shit  
email the people that followed me  
email worldindata folks,  
  
exploration  
  
Composed funding, all these itgers  
  
  
I wrote parts of this mostly out of annoyance at my inability to convince people to fund the thing

It doesn't matter that you want a particular way to deal with your conflict free stuff, the solution is not only to isolate an environment, but just to be able to deal or handle when it arises.  
  
Bridge the index list

---

It's not just about being able to work with unique data, but also about what you do when that's not available

Spreads ro sll possible until another is better and the kthers contracts, adtercseeing lightning,?

rsy visualizations together  
  
recursive generation etc .  
  
for index go through discord, zulip users of...  
  
compile lists of peojects  
  
  
35 m  
  
live roadmap, history can be seen here  
  
  
hidden something learning vertically not ?  
  
  
High fos water dropplet bounching off water myltiple times, each time higher the smaller it is, then merging witht he water structure below, local gravitational pressure breaks and then merges partially, shockwave below- interesting
