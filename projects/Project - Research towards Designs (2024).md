Once a simple interface is setup, we'll start to be able to design the next generation of that interface within the interface itself. Though it'll probably be useful to think about a lot of it off-screen. I'm putting this here mainly as a placeholder for now, and will come back to it after I'm back from Birmingham.

See: :orbitmines: [OrbitMines as a Game Project](https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project/#:~:text=A%20quick%20step%20towards%20Design)

It's very simple:

> This problem, though filled with incredible technical complexity, in its essence is a visual design problem: What should it feel like? What should it look like?

#### Game Intro
- Already allow moving around even in this quick intro? - even before collapse down
- Quick showcase of the possible worlds ; "See the possibilities" ; Too little to see isn't obvious enough. Short overwhelm, then calm
	- Simple 2d grid spans the screen (from one diagonal to the other) 
	- Some break in the middle ; 2d grid changes color maybe ; opening a portal in the middle.
		- You traverse through it, all around portals opening to possible worlds (other things people have made).
- Collapse back to a point, interface at rest ; "Waiting for you to start exploring"
	- *Could be like the old tv screen shutoff, sucked to the middle.*
- Somehow the idea of "find, extend/recursive",
	- Right from the start already dependent on user input
	- Point to a small figure
	- dot, line, grid, world, color, more complex world generation - till you're thrown in a more complicated world. 
		- See some direction to move into for each step. (; small step automatically, wait for the rest) ;  "Shift the attention focus at the start as a way of guiding the first few quests to get familiar with how it works"

#### Open World Generation
*A step to translating problems to game-like invariant quests, ..., puzzles.*

###### Open explorations/quests
*Explorers, researchers, traders, ..., pirates: Gatherers, crafters, ..., spreaders of items unknown to some, ... all*

###### Items & Quests
*Generalized variant, I see this thing in the world, in this particular place, want to decode this particular thing (some communication / item) I see. Can then unlock the ability to solve or see different items etc.. I have this other item/mod/type of vision to look through the world differently. "Portal through, see the world/inventory/server in a different way"*

*This is what functions, data, ..., information is.*
*This is what science, engineering, learning, ..., gaming will become.*

*Quests require Items ; Cannot see, ..., complete a quest, ..., puzzle without certain items.*
*Items require Quests ; In order to find items you need quests.*

*Quests are Items ; You can give a quest to someone else.*
*Items are Quests ; Your items might be quests to find for others.*

*Items are Inventories, Worlds, ..., Servers ; We can go inside items and explore there.*
*Items are Minimaps ; We can look at items from the outside to get an perspective, ..., overview of what it is.*
*Items can be used for crafting, combining, ..., creating.* 
*Items sometimes tell a story of how, ..., where they're made, but it's not always clear what that story is.*
*Items can be used without knowing the worlds inside them. ; Once you have them you can try to find more items about that story.*

*Items effect World Generation ; What you have found changes what you can find.*

*Items can be dropped, modded, ..., unequipped ; You can forget, ..., leave easter eggs for others to find.*
*Items can be dropped to change World Generation.*

*Items can be copied, ..., spread.*
*Items can be copied to change World Generation.*



#### Interface Design

- Any interface, hooks(/finds) unbound controls. Any follow-up changes hence possibly effected. Can be unbound, superposed, etc.. 
	- ; Latching of controls, defaults of controls from context. ; Additional controls based on kind of interface etc..
	- Basically move this aspects to [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]
- Existing interfaces

- Personalized world, ..., workspace
	- Aspects shareable, others not

- Functionality
	- Ignorance/dropping of any structured (say explicitly kept history or others), when used for something (say matching aspects of it to others structures etc..)
	- (Random) exploration (; worlds/items/..) ; Phrasing "random exploratory funtionality" ; "Periodic reminder/suggestion/exploration"
		- "What are places I haven't looked? What are the places I could want to look? What are the places I decide not to look but would still want too look?"
	- Better replay ; "replay/detective/.../fossile"
	- Like "npc/bot/exploration functionality I'm not doing myself/others"
		- [ ] Notify me when you've found something you deem relevant for this unknown (while we dont know how to solve some unknown)
		- [ ] This would allow for the hooking of the process by a programmer: Hey while you're still working on this thing, perhaps [some answer to some function] should be considered, what would happen then? (Basically simulating an answer by a programmer ; some arbitrary process which hooks into a function)  
		- [ ] Already start doing something while decision is pending - do the things which one can reverse?  

- Exploratory functionality ; people explore differently.
	- Some notion of not expecting people to explore by themselves - simplicity (vs others who do), and guiding a way to stimulate that exploration - some form of ???.

- Experience/Mana/Energy - Gravity/Entropy
	- [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]#differentiability / [[Writing - 2024. A Universal Language]]#compresison - some merge between these things, or where should this be put?
- 
	- Similarly, crafting, resource constraints and how to translate that to how it influences what one can see ; What can I change about my infrastructure vs what can't I? ; "Energy aware contexts, is how people refer to it"
	- Measurement of category if diversity for the thing its useful for
	- Assembly/Disassembly of items ; "Destruct this thing, use it for something else instead"
	- Paths already explored: Cave's, items are influencing what the caves, "what's been searched" by you/or by others/ what can you find.
		- Basically directing movement in a certain way ; Like the ants following a group
	- Don't forget that it's important that the furthering of certain steps can be arbitrarily delayed ; if resources aren't spent on them. (this, and all these things should have direct translations to the programming interfaces?)
	- How much storage?
	- We use up resources to realization of some invariance (symmetry), which lowers the search space, but increases possible interactions. (Basically higher-arity again) ; Non-trivial superpositions through that invariance.
	- From certain perspectives, how many operations need to be performed ; relative to some other thing
	- minimization, compression, of branches basically
	- novelty; basically change parametsrs til you find somer which are so unsual to the one's currently

(Cyber) Security
- Recognize aspects (what to break in/random exploration) ; invariances to things I know that sort of thing, but could be fleeting ; puzzle to solve. Not entering the world, but observing it or something I know about it.
- How do people not know you dropped it there (basically security and things.)

- [ ] If I can show it in some asymmetry in multiple ways, prefer to show in multiple ways to aid disambiguation ; or not always, but a better variant of this.

[[Project - Computer Networking, Security, Encryption  & Communication (2025?)]]
Server-like/find server-like functionality
- [ ] ideas loke actually being in some servers/having some server list/-like Minecraft, publically indexable etc. for people to collaborate their work in, is an essential idea. 
- [ ] Ways of finding you as "hook into your world"

#### Research of Games, Engines, ...
Link to [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]

- [ ] Are there people who have been thinking about game-invariant puzzles?

#### Audio
*research into this*
[[Pinar Temiz]], ..

- Audio ; basically like [[Writing - 2024. A Universal Language]] ; 'easy-rediscoverability/seperability in a certain way if not in the obvious seperation case.'
	- separate audio sources so disentanglement/referencing is easier ; basically separating the superposed things ; generalize

# UNPROCESSED
*Tread carefully, confusion abound*

---

- [ ] Holotile floor, and things like it, more future-oriented search

---

ring expanding then collapsing to a point. OM logo in the middle? ; small key to explode to outside


---

rotate thr whole thing
orbit local loop pull everything in

---

orbit matching whole thing or not, hence prine number maybe

---

going around the loop constantly ignoring dropping the one connection, unrolling the line on the loop, if both are a loop, could keep going / oscillate, or things like larger extent compare, or same frame cancel out when intersect  

- [ ] If no additional structure is defined, collapse reducible states in between to ("forgotten", but so many steps, or something similar.), Then one may still to that if there are intermediate points for which something is defined, as define it somewhere else.

Latch the initial, latch the .self, latch the .terminal, and we determine movement.



Features
- [ ] Take two or more poins, collapse them all to reference one thing?.  ; either that selection, or anything else found at that selection.
- [ ] Pulsing out, one perspective can't access but another can

Keyboard
- [ ] Singlke keybind for now to show/hide the ray disambiguation or 'dead edges/..'/
- [ ] Numbers on keyboard to length
- [ ] Number + parallel compose

---  

Put the graphs setc at the top, invis lines, then draw them on hover, and maybe make surrounding stuff less visiable. ; context of how to apply somethig. ; minimap as ignorant ref

- Import arbitrary structure (drag/copy/paste)
- Control
	- ignoring attachment of where came from, from which would follow the others as the same ignoring again the compariosn, collapsing the tei structures into each other ; ignoring the embedding. - Basically driving them to some "0 point"
	- Expand/collapse/superpose arbitrarily.
		- Can at each step choose which continuations to follow (`step`)
	- Bind structures to controls ; copy/paste, this key does this
	- Single key to show something for everything, ignored structure, could just me a simple program applied to the whole interface, show me all the 'orbits' on all the structure.
		- Basically: use loop to create line, rolling the loop oit by introducing variance in the traversing direction  
	- Some intuitive slider of some level of description over an existing interpretation to match it - quite dynamic
	- Draw arbitrary continuation to another level of description, basically taking some structure, trying to hook it into another structure ; Say the 2d grid of the screen into the cells of the gpu or something etc..
	- [ ] Which moves one can make depicted visually (<>, circular, etc..) 

	- draw with mouse, multiple in a line
	- Like a paintbrush slowly growing in certain directions having particular steuctures.

- [ ] If you ahve to use mouse, force lock on the structure, close to the mouse?? ; Generalized to drawing in, but this is also a bit of a problem when generalized.

Always, how detailed, how much context, how much can it latch on etc..
- Drag from one point of contact on the background to another place
