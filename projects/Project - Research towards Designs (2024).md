Once a simple interface is setup, we'll start to be able to design the next generation of that interface within the interface itself. Though it'll probably be useful to think about a lot of it off-screen. I'm putting this here mainly as a placeholder for now, and will come back to it after I'm back from Birmingham.

It's very simple:

> This problem, though filled with incredible technical complexity, in its essence is a visual design problem: What should it feel like? What should it look like?

#### Game Intro
- Quick showcase of the possible worlds
- Collapse back to a point, interface at rest, waiting for you to start exploring

#### Open World Generation


#### Interface Design
- Any interface, hooks(/finds) unbound controls. Any follow-up changes hence possibly effected. Can be unbound, superposed, etc.. 
- Existing interfaces

- Personalized world, ..., workspace
	- Aspects shareable, others not

- Functionality
	- Ignorance/dropping of any structured (say explicitly kept history or others), when used for something (say matching aspects of it to others structures etc..)
	- (Random) exploration (; worlds/items/..)
	- Better replay ; "replay/detective/.../fossile"
