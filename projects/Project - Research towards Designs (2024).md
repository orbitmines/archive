Once a simple interface is setup, we'll start to be able to design the next generation of that interface within the interface itself. Though it'll probably be useful to think about a lot of it off-screen. I'm putting this here mainly as a placeholder for now, and will come back to it after I'm back from Birmingham.

It's very simple:

> This problem, though filled with incredible technical complexity, in its essence is a visual design problem: What should it feel like? What should it look like?

#### Game Intro
- Already allow moving around even in this quick intro? - even before collapse down
- Quick showcase of the possible worlds ; "See the possibilities" ; Too little to see isn't obvious enough. Short overwhelm, then calm
	- Simple 2d grid spans the screen (from one diagonal to the other) 
	- Some break in the middle ; 2d grid changes color maybe ; opening a portal in the middle.
		- You traverse through it, all around portals opening to possible worlds (other things people have made).
- Collapse back to a point, interface at rest ; "Waiting for you to start exploring"
	- *Could be like the old tv screen shutoff, sucked to the middle.*
- Somehow the idea of "find, extend/recursive",
	- Right from the start already dependent on user input
	- Point to a small figure
	- dot, line, grid, world, color, more complex world generation - till you're thrown in a more complicated world. 
		- See some direction to move into for each step. (; small step automatically, wait for the rest) ;  "Shift the attention focus at the start as a way of guiding the first few quests to get familiar with how it works"

#### Open World Generation
*A step to translating problems to game-like invariant quests, ..., puzzles.*


#### Interface Design
- Any interface, hooks(/finds) unbound controls. Any follow-up changes hence possibly effected. Can be unbound, superposed, etc.. 
	- ; Latching of controls, defaults of controls from context. ; Additional controls based on kind of interface etc..
- Existing interfaces

- Personalized world, ..., workspace
	- Aspects shareable, others not

- Functionality
	- Ignorance/dropping of any structured (say explicitly kept history or others), when used for something (say matching aspects of it to others structures etc..)
	- (Random) exploration (; worlds/items/..) ; Phrasing "random exploratory funtionality" ; "Periodic reminder/suggestion/exploration"
		- "What are places I haven't looked? What are the places I could want to look? What are the places I decide not to look but would still want too look?"
	- Better replay ; "replay/detective/.../fossile"
