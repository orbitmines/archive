Once a simple interface is setup, we'll start to be able to design the next generation of that interface within the interface itself. Though it'll probably be useful to think about a lot of it off-screen. I'm putting this here mainly as a placeholder for now, and will come back to it after I'm back from Birmingham.

See: :orbitmines: [OrbitMines as a Game Project](https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project/#:~:text=A%20quick%20step%20towards%20Design)

It's very simple:

> This problem, though filled with incredible technical complexity, in its essence is a visual design problem: What should it feel like? What should it look like?

#### Game Intro
- Already allow moving around even in this quick intro? - even before collapse down
- Quick showcase of the possible worlds ; "See the possibilities" ; Too little to see isn't obvious enough. Short overwhelm, then calm
	- Simple 2d grid spans the screen (from one diagonal to the other) 
	- Some break in the middle ; 2d grid changes color maybe ; opening a portal in the middle.
		- You traverse through it, all around portals opening to possible worlds (other things people have made).
- Collapse back to a point, interface at rest ; "Waiting for you to start exploring"
	- *Could be like the old tv screen shutoff, sucked to the middle.*
- Somehow the idea of "find, extend/recursive",
	- Right from the start already dependent on user input
	- Point to a small figure
	- dot, line, grid, world, color, more complex world generation - till you're thrown in a more complicated world. 
		- See some direction to move into for each step. (; small step automatically, wait for the rest) ;  "Shift the attention focus at the start as a way of guiding the first few quests to get familiar with how it works"

#### Open World Generation
*A step to translating problems to game-like invariant quests, ..., puzzles.*

World Generation
- [ ] [DreamCraft: Text-Guided Generation of Functional 3D Environments in Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15538)
- [ ] 

###### Open explorations/quests
*Explorers, researchers, traders, ..., pirates: Gatherers, crafters, ..., spreaders of items unknown to some, ... all*

###### Items & Quests
*This is what functions, data, ..., information is.*
*This is what science, engineering, learning, ..., gaming will become.*


*Quests require Items ; Cannot see, ..., complete a quest, ..., puzzle without certain items.*
*Items require Quests ; In order to find items you need quests.*

*Quests are Items ; You can give a quest to someone else.*
*Items are Quests ; Your items might be quests to find for others.*

*Items are Inventories, Worlds, ..., Servers ; We can go inside items and explore there.*
*Items are Minimaps ; We can look at items from the outside to get an perspective, ..., overview of what it is.*
*Items can be used for crafting, combining, ..., creating.* 
*Items sometimes tell a story of how, ..., where they're made, but it's not always clear what that story is.*
*Items can be used without knowing the worlds inside them. ; Once you have them you can try to find more items about that story.*

*Items effect World Generation ; What you have found changes what you can find.*

*Items can be dropped, modded, ..., unequipped ; You can forget, ..., leave easter eggs for others to find.*
*Items can be dropped to change World Generation.*

*Items can be copied, ..., spread.*
*Items can be copied to change World Generation.*



#### Interface Design

- Any interface, hooks(/finds) unbound controls. Any follow-up changes hence possibly effected. Can be unbound, superposed, etc.. 
	- ; Latching of controls, defaults of controls from context. ; Additional controls based on kind of interface etc..
	- Basically move this aspects to [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]
- Existing interfaces

- Personalized world, ..., workspace
	- Aspects shareable, others not

- Functionality
	- Ignorance/dropping of any structured (say explicitly kept history or others), when used for something (say matching aspects of it to others structures etc..)
	- (Random) exploration (; worlds/items/..) ; Phrasing "random exploratory funtionality" ; "Periodic reminder/suggestion/exploration"
		- "What are places I haven't looked? What are the places I could want to look? What are the places I decide not to look but would still want too look?"
	- Better replay ; "replay/detective/.../fossile"

- Exploratory functionality ; people explore differently.
	- Some notion of not expecting people to explore by themselves - simplicity (vs others who do), and guiding a way to stimulate that exploration - some form of ???.

- Experience/Mana/Energy - Gravity/Entropy
	- [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]#differentiability
	- Similarly, crafting, resource constraints and how to translate that to how it influences what one can see ; What can I change about my infrastructure vs what can't I? ; "Energy aware contexts, is how people refer to it"
	- Measurement of category if diversity for the thing its useful for
	- Assembly/Disassembly of items ; "Destruct this thing, use it for something else instead"

(Cyber) Security
- Recognize aspects (what to break in/random exploration) ; invariances to things I know that sort of thing, but could be fleeting ; puzzle to solve. Not entering the world, but observing it or something I know about it.
- How do people not know you dropped it there (basically security and things.)

- [ ] If I can show it in some asymmetry in multiple ways, prefer to show in multiple ways to aid disambiguation ; or not always, but a better variant of this.

Generalized variant, I see this thing in the world, in this particular plaze, want to decode this particular thing (some communicatoin / item) I see. Can then unlock the ability to solve or see different items etc..

[[Project - Computer Networking, Security, Encryption  & Communication (2025?)]]
Server-like/find server-like functionality
- [ ] ideas loke actually being in some servers/having some server list/-like Minecraft, publically indexable etc. for people to collaborate their work in, is an essential idea. 
- [ ] Ways of finding you as "hook into your world"

#### Audio
*research into this*
[[Pinar Temiz]], ..

- Audio ; basically like [[Project - (Hypergraphic) Version Control System through Rays (2024)]] ; 'easy-rediscoverability/seperability in a certain way if not in the obvious seperation case.'
	- separate audio sources so disentanglement/referencing is easier ; basically separating the superposed things ; generalize
