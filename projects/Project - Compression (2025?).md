A lot of my current thinking can be linked back to struggling (incredibly naively) trying to understand compression (around 2020-2022). Though my recent interests are not specifically on compression of any particular kind, I'm quite certain that aspects of it will come to the forefront on a lot of the other projects.

*Who knows, I might try another stab at the Hutter Prize (http://prize.hutter1.net/)*

Compression/entropy

Coarse//graining as a structural property since the proability function might as well be seen as a function applied to the whole non-ignorant structure, which f"foirgets" the structure in some sense, but which persists in the structure in the other sense since the funcction was applied in the context of the structure.

Uncertasinty not in the sense of "acctually a measure of uncertainty" -it's that this is influenced by what thing is doin ghte equivalencing of the entropic things - tbasically szaying ":that shouldn't be taken out of context." But it might as well be the case that one doesn't ingnore that to begin with, and then the information one does hold up, it's merely by ignoing that one usually deals with some other structure doing the equivalencing, that one is more geared towards saying it's a measure of uncertainty than information, of course it's a measure of information, it's just that either way of phrasing it is assmuning other things about what counts as part of that structure.

Any programmed function/sets of bits, lowers the possible search space, by occupying structural limitations (though this assumes they are checked/traversed, they could be ignored). Bit since we assume some invariance (whether actually accurate is another thing), will also decrease the sesrch space nontrivially by disallowing certain combinations as redundant. 

We use up resources in order to allow for the awareness of some conceived invariance (symmetry), which lowers the search space (if that route is chosen), but interestingly increases possible interactions (does this increase/decrease the search space?) out of this realization of invariance. ; we remove some redundancy by setting up this invariance. (if the storage of this invariance realization is lower than the possibilities enabled by this invariance) ; One is basically setting up a possible nontrivial superposition through that invariance.;

; (as  a reference to th eplanet's coordinates, curvature as incompressibility)
The circular can't unwrap thing Jonathan mentioned might be similar statement to knot theory, or again that the loop of something defines that unwrappability. - This is also relevant to homotopy/topology. Some different level of description against this with something "in between" nonmappable/equivalenced/ignored?  
  
The way [[Jonathan Gorard]] phrases it (in reference to that work) makes me think to phrase curvature and noncompressability ("no further compressability?" - abstractly that is

All compressions necessarily add reversibility considerations.

For lossless compression, one needs to not only restore the selected permutation from a selection of possibilities, but also more non-trivial aspects, like the structure or positional encoding of those permutation selections. For binary sequences, it's somewhat easy to ignore this detail because its representation is so abstractly uniform, but nonetheless. 0-0-0-1, is different than 0-11-01-0: The conceptualization of a state, is some selected permutation from some perceived space of possible permutations. So in effect, it's an extra structural directionality at each point. That doesn't necessarily we know each permutation value, nor can iterate over all of them? (Could be drawn to the gaussian function/blurring thing? ; Less permutations/less possible details/information at some point, so different function, not necessarily 'better' in every possible way, merely different.)

The whole structure is relevent for compression. Hence if one groups some structure of 8 bits into a byte and say; they're equivalent in some sense to the 8 bits, but define that grouping differently than the rest of the structure; (show), there may be questions which would want that structure explicitly, and that would change how one compresses.

Is reducing the number of connectings at fdrames, and only to othger directions spaces whgat signifies a partical kind of compression?

- [ ] Re-conceptualize the best known compression as a perceived geodesic in a certain non-trivial directionality. Shortest distance in size. ; generalization of geodesic.


- [ ] Rule out obvious [[WebAssembly]] redundancies
  - [ ] Nice feature of the wasm binary is we can export the compress/decompress function from the same binary, and their order in the binary has some invariance. Which simplifies are definition of the search space: We're looking for a dual function export from a single binary.


- [ ] We don't necessarily have to understand the host environment and assume consistency of [[WebAssembly]]'s assumptions. Relying on this sort of assumption is usually also what programming has primarily been - (perhaps say something about want to move to a more dynamic case where this isn't necessarily the case?). 


- [ ] on the using existing data on disk etc./ One could simply see it as additional resources, capabilities, function, however one wants to define it. It generally can (and should) alter possible compression for anything that follows. Though this consideration] not in the scope for this prize.
