For a lot of purposes I want to be able to talk in the language of Rays - albeit in :orbitmines: OrbitMines' interface - and have a native conversion to GPU infrastructures. I've currently got the expectation that :tinygrad: Tinygrad offers the easiest road to get there. 

- So initially, either compile Rays to :tinygrad: Tinygrad ops, Tinygrad ops to Rays. Or at least understand what the library is doing well enough to write my own. (This will also allow me to gain some practical experience with GPUs/hardware.)
- This will probably require an implementation of Rays in python.

This is a dependency for:
- OrbitMines as a Game Project.
