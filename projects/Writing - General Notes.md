*Just some basic steering to a particular kind of style...*
### Stylistics Choices

- [ ] Add to publically-made promises
- [ ] Permeating caution ; Re-read/Post-process to lessen vagueness
- [ ] Don't use "a set of" - to not confuse mathematics set
  - [ ] Too much "necessarily?" - alternatives? ("necessary, seeming, non-trivival ..)
  - [ ] No common phrases
  - [ ] Avoid 'nature of'
  - [ ] No quoting random things
  - [ ] Newly devised term use a hyphen to indicate the words should merge.
  - [ ] (temporally) stable/coherence/consistent instead of balance/harmony as a word.
  - [ ] Avoid 'in fact'/'fact'
  - [ ] Complex/complicated? (Complex is fine?)
  - [ ] Avoid 'dependent on' for '???'
  - [ ] Avoid 'this paper' for 'this arc'
  - [ ] Phrase real/imaginary, theorem/non-theorem, generalized as multiple directionlities (products?) at some point.
  - [ ] Avoid 'is' for 'seems'/'perceived to be'/...? - some icon to heighten uncertainty
  - [ ] Let's not use hardware/software distinction, merely use systems. Underlying system with properties arbitrarily unknown
    - [ ] Any similar distinctions I shouldn't be using, which aren't explicitly relative?
