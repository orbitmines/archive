Placing this here as a placeholder for anyone else to contribute. New networking infrastructure will be a requirement at some point.

Some random notes on this can be found in the archive.
- [ ] Similar to all other projects, this will require some research into what has been done by others and people with similar goals.

Read: [Perfectly Secure Steganography using Minimum Entropy Coupling (2023)](../read/2210.14889.pdf) ; Would confirm some ungrounded suspicions I had some time ago. Let's return to steganography later on.

- [ ] Ideas from cyber-security: honeypots  
- [ ] homomorphic encryption  
- [ ] Cryptographic computing: zkSync/zkEVM, Lurk, FHE  - 
###### stenography
[[2023-11-16]]
Im reminded of some idea to use the hits in something like any image/article and built from there violations ([[2023-12-07]]; as some entry into stenography)

- [ ] Additional layer in security in the form of a secondary encrypted target which is more likely to be found by an adversary as to discourage further inquiry? (Where that target would be some plausible-encrypted message.) Possible multiple of those. Is there anything in the literature to suggest something like this as a possibility? If not, then it'll likely at some point be discovered and effectively used, especially if this is easily automated.
