*Better variant of [[Project - OrbitMines as a Game (2025-2026?)]]*
*OrbitMines' Strategy, Scope, ..., Roadmap, Technology*
*The Glass Bead Game but the solution to The Glass Bead Game is The Glass Bead Game.*
*The GBG but the solution to The GBG is The GBG.*
*Could also just go here: A minimap of how the metaverse is actually going to happen. And accidentally rename something to the fadiverse along the way.*
*The Linux of programming languages*
*A world in which learning, science, ..., engineering are all an exploratory game.*
*All ongoing projects in a single overview.*

Many of these steps are still quite uncertain, but the direction is clear.

Bit of frustration while at Birmingham
- Don't expect people to navigate the site, just assume people are not explorative enough to do that, and put all the shit of the entire project on a single page
- Don't expect people to understand the scope of the project I'm not searching I've found the damn thing and now it's implementation time  
- "Reach out - but actually do ; I'm always curious as to your projects or why this peaks your interest "

###### Items & Quests
*This is what functions, data, ..., information is.*
*This is what science, engineering, learning, ..., gaming will become.*


*Quests require Items ; Cannot see, ..., complete a quest, ..., puzzle without certain items.*
*Items require Quests ; In order to find items you need quests.*

*Quests are Items ; You can give a quest to someone else.*
*Items are Quests ; Your items might be quests to find for others.*

*Items are Inventories, Worlds, ..., Servers ; We can go inside items and explore there.*
*Items are Minimaps ; We can look at items from the outside to get an perspective, ..., overview of what it is.*
*Items can be used for crafting, combining, ..., creating.* 
*Items sometimes tell a story of how, ..., where they're made, but it's not always clear what that story is.*
*Items can be used without knowing the worlds inside them. ; Once you have them you can try to find more items about that story.*

*Items effect World Generation ; What you have found changes what you can find.*

*Items can be dropped, modded, ..., unequipped ; You can forget, ..., leave easter eggs for others to find.*
*Items can be dropped to change World Generation.*

*Items can be copied, ..., spread.*
*Items can be copied to change World Generation.*
