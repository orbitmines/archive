*Will always be ongoing - basically realizable as economic/practical/logistical considerations for the projects*
*Like things with hiring, always try to cover the things not already covered with a different approach*

Scaling?
- [ ] I just need time to work on the ideas, there's not a lot other than a small compute station or involving other in costs for now, so these probably don't make much sense yet. Maybe would want to involve other people soon though.

#### Once already operating, so either for me or someone else to handle this
*always more exploration..*

  - ![[R&D-samenwerkingsprojecten]] / [[R&D-samenwerkingsprojecten en ArtificiÃ«le Intelligentie (AI)]]
	  - [ ] Most realistic, do this after an initial injection of cash. Get a 2nd person involved, should cover 35% of costs of the project early on.


#### Proposals that need obviousness so people can understand the scope of the project - It's value needs to be clear
- [ ] [[Dutch Research Council (NWO)]] 
  - [ ] Starter-grant (or was this ERC??)
  - [ ] Summit grant (2024?) : If the conceptual framework is sufficiently advanced a 2024 equivalent of this perhaps (https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/summit-grant)  
    - Have to convince a 10-12 multidisciplinary board: https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/open-technology-programme-2023, so far the most interesting looking one. Technically signalled for a associate professor, but we'll see.  
    ~~- "I suppose that this admission will be quite irregular, and a detailed background is justified." ; Get around the "usually for universities"  ~~
- [x] Look if this is a possible grant [Fundamentals of Software Engineering (RIA) 15 Nov 2023 - 19 March 2024](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl4-2024-digital-emerging-01-22;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=computer;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=0,1,2,8;statusCodes=31094501,31094502;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=43108390;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState) ; All these are based on large project initiatives, will need to have something already setup to even be remotely considered for something like this.

#### Useless

##### Longshots - only if it's clear I have something
*Long shots like this should more be like additional ways of acquiring funding along the line, those which align with the things I'm already doing. Not focus on this stuff directly. Basically, they should mostly be the small work of converting the ideas to understandable format to attack those problems, not solely focus on them.*
- [ ] Could try another crack at the [[Hutter Prize]] - I need to see definite progress in a week, otherwise conclude it wont work - probably not this again, go for something more sure, retry prize later.]]
- [ ] [[AIMO Prize]]
###### Some random Prize Deadlines
- [ ] uni-mainz [[2024-09-31]], 20k Computational Phenomenolgy 

##### Useless ^ 2
- `.nl`
	- [[Innovatiemakelaarsregeling]]
	- [[Haalbaarheidsprojecten]]
	- [[Kennisvouchers]] (if this is more broad could be useful)
	- [[Mkb-innovatiestimulering Regio en Topsectoren (MIT)]]

#### Forgotten
- [x] [[Project - Bug Bounty Programs]]
	- This sort of thing won't be sustainable, just more of the `longshots` above. It works more for understanding code-bases.
- [x] [[A letter to all university professors whom in may concern (2023) - Project PHD?]]
	- [ ] Doesn't really align well with the other things I want to do. This will probably be a last resort before joining other projects.
- [x] https://apply.opentech.fund/apply/submissions/16507/#submission-details
	- Doesn't align with their objectives. (Weird? Probably didn't communicate that aspect properly - which by default the project enables as infrastructure for that which solves their problems.). Definitely didn't make that obvious.
