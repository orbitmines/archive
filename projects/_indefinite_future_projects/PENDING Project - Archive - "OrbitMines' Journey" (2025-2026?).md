I want both my and :orbitmines: OrbitMines' archives to be better managed and published online. This includes in particular any OrbitMines' Minecraft history which survived, including its codebase. This should tell "OrbitMines' Story" from 2013-2019 better than I could in words.

On the Discord there's a channel setup which already includes a lot of archive material, but it's far from everything (https://discord.com/channels/1055502602365845534/1126441974040379442).



The currently uploaded Minecraft archives includes:

## Arc: OrbitMines' Timeline (2013-2023)
##### A quick journey of getting here

- [ ] Dont forget to include the Discord stuff others have shared

- [ ] After archive project ; history of OrbitMiens + robert etc. first idea came from decompoling java files to create mc plugins ; can already see similar ideas there.

---
- [ ] old projects
	- [ ] Project X/Ruby writer/.. ; I should look back into that project and see what other interesting ideas I had which I haven't written down explicitly/forgotten and could be of use here.
- [ ] 2026~? Allow linking into this by others ; this is going to be tricky though ; delay this till 2026~?.
- [ ] Index older projects, look for some similarities in ideas  - or for some interesting ones
- [ ] Also archive personal/family data while at it  
- [ ] Local hardware redundancy & health monitoring
