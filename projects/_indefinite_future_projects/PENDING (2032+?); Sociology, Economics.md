You probably wouldn't want to normalize (ie create the pressure that you must) publishing you everything do online - but that's probably what I'm signalling to now

What do you do in a world where finding something is the hard part, then copying and redistributing takes resources, but copying is a pretty universal resource. This has basically been the transition/history of software?

Is there a word for: "Something happens, filter is put up to deal with it, then it's precisely that filter which becomes the problem."
[[2024-02-07]]
Magic def as something happens without an intermediate step, but then how could you possibly be certain of that?

just 'speed limit' as it discourages inquiry in its possible dissociation with light speed.

I wouldn't necessarily frame it as first principles. Seems likely that that promotes the line of thinking that what one has discussed are indeed the first principles and not something more permeating, excluded from those ideas, which is something to be considered. Probably a conclusion to be drawn from that, that advice is more likely to be useful when sufficiently vague. A sort of psychological manipulation: See here a vague pattern I associate with this thing, see that pattern: it means this thing.

Perhaps it's worth reading on some linguistics as to figure out som non-trivial ways to leverage human capability to understand symbols language efficiently? (; To better compactly 'store' complex propositions.)

It wouldn't surprise me if someone who was blind has a better capability to navigate visually/abstractly in much more detail than those who can see. (; usually?)

Random thought from Tuesday while with alex&dani, more activity/relativistic/... affects differently the perception - is it conceivable that dreaming is a similar thing where in the last moment of waking up relatively all that is experienced in that instant compared to the experience of others? - Probably not the case (Alex), but it's still an interesting thought and at least generally possible maybe?

Defocussed eyes seem to rely on color to readjust? - Can focus to something with a similar color incorrectly
[[2023-10-12]]
Vission working loke this: positional encodings of the field is the same, movr away from focus, the abstraction layer on top changes (further away from focus becomes smaller number of nodes anove the positional encodingz hence perceived smaller) focus on it, mor information more jodes, more dedicated resources) - probably some oversimplification, but an easy to visualize how the positional encoding doesn't change but the description above abstractly attached to it does.

Shouldn't phrase color illusion as an illusion, better to phrase it that what color is to your mind is not just simple spectrum with some opposites. It necessarily uses context too, it is much more nontrivial. At some point the wavelengths are the same frequency. - But your mind does not interpet it like wavelengths, it is likely much more nontrivial. - Similar things said elsewhere? How to showcase this nonteiviality? - Is it a necessary aspect or is it possible to only abide by the wavelengths, and what sort of processing would one lose if it did. Because they're likely significantly different perceptions - perhaps it wouldn't look similar at all - perhaps it wouldn't functions respond similar at all. Less information, less contextual relations?

Eyes/Mind correct for predictable lines/shapes similarly..

Much less stable encoding on many exploretive features of the brain? Perhaps the more primitive ones of position and colors are more fixed/stable, more easily accessible in some nontrivial way?
