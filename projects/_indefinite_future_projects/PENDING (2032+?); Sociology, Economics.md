You probably wouldn't want to normalize (ie create the pressure that you must) publishing you everything do online - but that's probably what I'm signalling to now

What do you do in a world where finding something is the hard part, then copying and redistributing takes resources, but copying is a pretty universal resource. This has basically been the transition/history of software?

Vission working loke this: positional encodings of the field is the same, movr away from focus, the abstraction layer on top changes (further away from focus becomes smaller number of nodes anove the positional encodingz hence perceived smaller) focus on it, mor information more jodes, more dedicated resources) - probably some oversimplification, but an easy to visualize how the positional encoding doesn't change but the description above abstractly attached to it does.
