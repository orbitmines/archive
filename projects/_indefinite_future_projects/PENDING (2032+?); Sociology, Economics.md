# UNPROCESSED

You probably wouldn't want to normalize (ie create the pressure that you must) publishing you everything do online - but that's probably what I'm signalling to now

What do you do in a world where finding something is the hard part, then copying and redistributing takes resources, but copying is a pretty universal resource. This has basically been the transition/history of software?

Same argument different perspective different conclusion. (; also as an example of a possible human confusion)

##### Social - Linguistics
Words are often mainly used without properly understanding the history of their use by others.

- [ ] Inventing some words?
	- Words for:
		-   "level of description/abstraction/more generalized scale invariance"? - Superposing languages/

	- [ ] Have some notes scattered through the archive looking for ords.
	- [ ] Another missing English thing, "I find this for me" not generally, not expanding generally, merely that severely constrained something is believed to be the case
	      - [ ] Why is something done? Do the rules in place even reflect that? (understanding/understanding)

Is there a word for: "Something happens, filter is put up to deal with it, then it's precisely that filter which becomes the problem."

Magic def as something happens without an intermediate step, but then how could you possibly be certain of that?

just 'speed limit' as it discourages inquiry in its possible dissociation with light speed.

Is it words/names of things, in programming, ..., natural languages which disallow for generalization: i.e. they make disentanglement hard between other structure and those words/names. ; Then generalization from ignorance of names?

I wouldn't necessarily frame it as first principles. Seems likely that that promotes the line of thinking that what one has discussed are indeed the first principles and not something more permeating, excluded from those ideas, which is something to be considered. Probably a conclusion to be drawn from that, that advice is more likely to be useful when sufficiently vague. A sort of psychological manipulation: See here a vague pattern I associate with this thing, see that pattern: it means this thing.

Perhaps it's worth reading on some linguistics as to figure out som non-trivial ways to leverage human capability to understand symbols language efficiently? (; To better compactly 'store' complex propositions.)

Secrets: Given the idea that one's recollection of events (memory) is imperfect, the 'keeping of secrets' is an interesting concept. If one isn't even fully able to recall one's memory, let alone that of another. A 'secret' then is the call to something the 'other person ought to know' or 'significant information', which requires the modelling of another system. Why had they 'ought to know'/'want to know'/'should know'/...?

Although I don't think Asimov explicitly stated it but hinted at it. The Gaian preference to use as little syllables as possible to refer to some human-as-a-component seems revealing in the sense that as little information ad possible is used as to not have to disambiguate constantly (through multiple possible reference options). Optimizing for efficiency in the sense of low information density, and computational efficiency in the sense of realizing when ambiguity will exist, and allowing for more information to be used as to not have to use computation in the form of transformations (time-efficient), but positionally encode it into the syllables & location/reference of where the information was acquired.

##### Social - History
Thought popped up earlier today that I should get some better understanding of archaic greek. Followed by the idea that any understanding of language would necessarily be different from prior learned languages. It's seems inconceivable one would be able to understand the language properly as back when it was more frequently used. And that learning it will change the relation and understanding of other languages.

Intelligence - partially practical ignorance

It wouldn't surprise me if someone who was blind has a better capability to navigate visually/abstractly in much more detail than those who can see. (; usually?)

Random thought from Tuesday while with alex&dani, more activity/relativistic/... affects differently the perception - is it conceivable that dreaming is a similar thing where in the last moment of waking up relatively all that is experienced in that instant compared to the experience of others? - Probably not the case (Alex), but it's still an interesting thought and at least generally possible maybe?

Defocussed eyes seem to rely on color to readjust? - Can focus to something with a similar color incorrectly
[[2023-10-12]]
Vission working loke this: positional encodings of the field is the same, movr away from focus, the abstraction layer on top changes (further away from focus becomes smaller number of nodes anove the positional encodingz hence perceived smaller) focus on it, mor information more jodes, more dedicated resources) - probably some oversimplification, but an easy to visualize how the positional encoding doesn't change but the description above abstractly attached to it does.

Shouldn't phrase color illusion as an illusion, better to phrase it that what color is to your mind is not just simple spectrum with some opposites. It necessarily uses context too, it is much more nontrivial. At some point the wavelengths are the same frequency. - But your mind does not interpet it like wavelengths, it is likely much more nontrivial. - Similar things said elsewhere? How to showcase this nonteiviality? - Is it a necessary aspect or is it possible to only abide by the wavelengths, and what sort of processing would one lose if it did. Because they're likely significantly different perceptions - perhaps it wouldn't look similar at all - perhaps it wouldn't functions respond similar at all. Less information, less contextual relations?

Eyes/Mind correct for predictable lines/shapes similarly..

Much less stable encoding on many exploretive features of the brain? Perhaps the more primitive ones of position and colors are more fixed/stable, more easily accessible in some nontrivial way?

On definitions: Differences/appropriateness/matters of controversy: Differences visually, are easily pointed out by the human mind, but any differences between things are worth figuring out why something is different and how that effects the world. It's not so hard to imagine that a human mind never exposed to a particular visual stimulus of other human that is notably different from one's previously seen, could merit this. What's significant is whether such differences should result into different treatment, and the psychological arguments that independent of moral claims that anything unusual (where unusual could be defined; as not having seen before from a particular observer's perspective), merits curiosity/adversity/.... With sciences in  place it is not that hard to create a link between visual differences and a biological explanation (whether finding that is trivial or non-trivial matters not for this line of reasoning). It is whether differences resulting in different observations/actions following from observations, are deemed (morally or practically) as something (a bias applied) appropriate.

A curious question that keeps me wondering: Why the visual experience oriented one way over a perfect mirroring? The observer wouldn't know the difference of course, then what does the particular form represent? Why one over the other? - My first guess would be some ordering it what happens first, what updates first, or some boundary in the universe which says this one comes first?

  - vs. "false memory"/I can still make that conclusion even though my mechanism of getting there isn't accurate.  (possibly not really, just for inaccurate reasons possibly (in)accurate) memory of loop having happened some number of times "

- [ ] point becomes its own direction: I suspect the source of a great many human confusions would be the interpretation of the direction at the point, while simultaneously not being aware of that that's what abstractly been done.
