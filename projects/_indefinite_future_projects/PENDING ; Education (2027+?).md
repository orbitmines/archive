I'm putting this here mainly as an invitation for anyone to contribute. All OrbitMines projects, notably: 
- [OrbitMines as a Game Project]()
- [Project - Research towards Designs (2024)]()

Will make it possible to design a completely different category of educational systems. This is an incredibly complex problem, but everything about around OrbitMines will make thinking about these problems much easier. (It will take )

Lots of time needs to go into the project before it's remotely ready for this.

Very simple, ignore the stuff around highschools universities and governments. Just create an education tool so good people/young people start using it outside of school. Hence a [[Project - OrbitMines as a Game (2025-2026?)]] they start playing outside of school, which eventually forces current education to adapt cause they're ancient no changing tactics don't change. - Just have them use it too.
