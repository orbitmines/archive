Once a simple interface is setup, we'll start to be able to design the next generation of that interface within the interface itself. Though it'll probably be useful to think about a lot of it off-screen. I'm putting this here mainly as a placeholder for now, and will come back to it after I'm back from Birmingham.

See: :orbitmines: [OrbitMines as a Game Project](https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project/#:~:text=A%20quick%20step%20towards%20Design)

It's very simple:

> This problem, though filled with incredible technical complexity, in its essence is a visual design problem: What should it feel like? What should it look like?

#### Game Intro
- Already allow moving around even in this quick intro? - even before collapse down
- Quick showcase of the possible worlds ; "See the possibilities" ; Too little to see isn't obvious enough. Short overwhelm, then calm
	- Simple 2d grid spans the screen (from one diagonal to the other) 
	- Some break in the middle ; 2d grid changes color maybe ; opening a portal in the middle.
		- You traverse through it, all around portals opening to possible worlds (other things people have made).
- Collapse back to a point, interface at rest ; "Waiting for you to start exploring"
	- *Could be like the old tv screen shutoff, sucked to the middle.*
- Somehow the idea of "find, extend/recursive",
	- Right from the start already dependent on user input
	- Point to a small figure
	- dot, line, grid, world, color, more complex world generation - till you're thrown in a more complicated world. 
		- See some direction to move into for each step. (; small step automatically, wait for the rest) ;  "Shift the attention focus at the start as a way of guiding the first few quests to get familiar with how it works"

#### Open World Generation
*A step to translating problems to game-like invariant quests, ..., puzzles.*

###### Open explorations/quests
*Explorers, researchers, traders, ..., pirates: Gatherers, crafters, ..., spreaders of items unknown to some, ... all*

###### Items & Quests
*Generalized variant, I see this thing in the world, in this particular place, want to decode this particular thing (some communication / item) I see. Can then unlock the ability to solve or see different items etc.. I have this other item/mod/type of vision to look through the world differently. "Portal through, see the world/inventory/server in a different way"*

#### Interface Design

- Collapse blocks of code down to an english summarization of what the code does.

- Any interface, hooks(/finds) unbound controls. Any follow-up changes hence possibly effected. Can be unbound, superposed, etc.. 
	- ; Latching of controls, defaults of controls from context. ; Additional controls based on kind of interface etc..
	- Basically move this aspects to [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]
- Existing interfaces

- Personalized world, ..., workspace
	- Aspects shareable, others not

- Functionality
	- Ignorance/dropping of any structured (say explicitly kept history or others), when used for something (say matching aspects of it to others structures etc..)
	- (Random) exploration (; worlds/items/..) ; Phrasing "random exploratory funtionality" ; "Periodic reminder/suggestion/exploration"
		- "What are places I haven't looked? What are the places I could want to look? What are the places I decide not to look but would still want too look?"
	- Better replay ; "replay/detective/.../fossile"
	- Like "npc/bot/exploration functionality I'm not doing myself/others"
		- [ ] Notify me when you've found something you deem relevant for this unknown (while we dont know how to solve some unknown)
		- [ ] This would allow for the hooking of the process by a programmer: Hey while you're still working on this thing, perhaps [some answer to some function] should be considered, what would happen then? (Basically simulating an answer by a programmer ; some arbitrary process which hooks into a function)  
		- [ ] Already start doing something while decision is pending - do the things which one can reverse?  
	- You want to do things like "include this thing like a video", if one has access to that - for instance if it needs to be paid for conditionally, in this place in the rest of the structure. That way you can conditionally include things and get around ownership issues, since it'll only be displayed to ones that do have access. -> For certain things a feature like this would be obnoxious though, so what's a good usage for a thing like this.

- Exploratory functionality ; people explore differently.
	- Some notion of not expecting people to explore by themselves - simplicity (vs others who do), and guiding a way to stimulate that exploration - some form of ???.

- Experience/Mana/Energy - Gravity/Entropy
- Use the emergent gravity idea from spatial density to construct spaces
	- [[Project - Indexing existing Abstract Models (2024-2025?)]]#differentiability / [[Writing - 2025. A Universal Language]]#compresison - some merge between these things, or where should this be put?
- 
	- Similarly, crafting, resource constraints and how to translate that to how it influences what one can see ; What can I change about my infrastructure vs what can't I? ; "Energy aware contexts, is how people refer to it"
	- Measurement of category if diversity for the thing its useful for
	- Assembly/Disassembly of items ; "Destruct this thing, use it for something else instead"
	- Paths already explored: Cave's, items are influencing what the caves, "what's been searched" by you/or by others/ what can you find.
		- Basically directing movement in a certain way ; Like the ants following a group
	- Don't forget that it's important that the furthering of certain steps can be arbitrarily delayed ; if resources aren't spent on them. (this, and all these things should have direct translations to the programming interfaces?)
	- How much storage?
	- We use up resources to realization of some invariance (symmetry), which lowers the search space, but increases possible interactions. (Basically higher-arity again) ; Non-trivial superpositions through that invariance.
	- From certain perspectives, how many operations need to be performed ; relative to some other thing
	- minimization, compression, of branches basically
	- novelty; basically change parametsrs til you find somer which are so unsual to the one's currently

(Cyber) Security
- Recognize aspects (what to break in/random exploration) ; invariances to things I know that sort of thing, but could be fleeting ; puzzle to solve. Not entering the world, but observing it or something I know about it.
- How do people not know you dropped it there (basically security and things.)

- [ ] If I can show it in some asymmetry in multiple ways, prefer to show in multiple ways to aid disambiguation ; or not always, but a better variant of this.

#### Audio
People: [[Pinar Temiz]], ..

- Audio ; basically like [[Writing - 2025. A Universal Language]] ; 'easy-rediscoverability/seperability in a certain way if not in the obvious seperation case.'
	- separate audio sources so disentanglement/referencing is easier ; basically separating the superposed things ; generalize

# UNPROCESSED
*Tread carefully, confusion abound*

Controller as main programming language tooling:
"The problem of translating 'usual programming language interface' to one which is more constricted'."
- Call nestedly in a variable by moving inside the object and selecting a field like that.
- .expand - Both joysticks to the outside
- .collapse - Both joysticks to the inside
- 2 cursors with both joysticks
	- Right scroll and select directionally left-right inside outside next scope. Up downis up-down next scope. Where it selects the next best thing, but moves smoothly.
- Somthing like down/trigger/bumper for voice recognition, with a quick-edit to change the result. Which hijacks usual right-joystick control?
	- Needs a good alternative if it's not possible rn
- Using AI and joysticks for word typing to move across a usual keyboard? How about less usual inputs, like repeated Q.s? RIght trigger + Right stick for where to start, left trigger for a movement. First entry is difficult, repeats is easier. Or quickly typing 1234567890
	- Disamiguation of manby options necessary? Left trigger up/down 
- Space of keyboard to target input to allow easy internationalization
- Allow with voice to spell out words if they;'re not yet in the dictionary, use words in 'project' - being the user-level / project-level etc.., directory as more likely.
- X call property
- Square, call method
- Circle ctrl+z, triangle ctrl+y
- Hold left joystick - do something with current selection, and then right joystick to do things like turn a == into a !=.
- Right trigger swap between Many/Array/Graph/Tree.

- What about even more restrictive interfaces like some VR controllers?

Desktop environment which is a 3d room with items/files in specific places. cudtom look in 3d rendering. like a book or a project. Search highlights the in 3d place. Hide stuff "in the air" at certain locations. Access the environment in the usual text/terminal format, define searchfunctions in that or 3d format

Instead of having the entire 3d structure in memory different nodes of "in between with distance x", allow overlapping 

#### open questions
Reconceptualize a problem as movement in some structure. A toy example would be finding a path from A->B by hand, and having a tool which automatically explores in a particular way (tactic).

What would be a problem to translate?

What would be its structure?

What tools (tactics basically) would be used?

How does one apply the tools?

What would be intermediate feedback states to communicate?

How do we know we've reached a solution?

What would be an example of a whole class of problems which are solved by some solution?

What select which problems are interesting to solve? / Which problems are open and their effect if solved. (Effect might be access to unknown structures, how is that quantified)

Which problems are much harder than simple navigation. Like exponentially exploding search spaces like possible programs?

Some currency of how much (efficiency/value --> What is the effect of this discovery) is gained 

How would you rephrase a programming language into an interactive tool which doesn't make use of variable names and much keyboard input besides moving?

Which problems are NOT translatable?

Which problems are easily translatable?

What about dynamic spaces? Is it searching for a specific type of behavior.


---

Example problems:
- cryptography problem (for certain problems you could have a timer on how it would take some tactic to solve it)
- theorem proving (can you reach or prove to not reach a certain state).
  -> Every problem is like this
- Search for equivalent but more efficient programs
   - Some importance on their usage -> What's the effect that's caused by some optimization 
- Search for equivalencies (vague?)
- program writing
- 
 
These are all abstract examples, I need something concrete 
---

- Existing programming languages with a more constrained interface like a controller.


Non-trivial interfaces
- [ ] Holotile floor, and things like it, more future-oriented search
- [ ] Tacticle/body movements, ...m anything

---

Features
- [ ] Take two or more poins, collapse them all to reference one thing?.  ; either that selection, or anything else found at that selection.
- [ ] Pulsing out, one perspective can't access but another can

Keyboard
- [ ] Singlke keybind for now to show/hide the ray disambiguation or 'dead edges/..'/
- [ ] Numbers on keyboard to length
- [ ] Number + parallel compose

---  

- Idea for chyp-like functionaltiy: Put the graphs setc at the top, invis lines, then draw them on hover, and maybe make surrounding stuff less visiable. ; context of how to apply somethig. ; minimap as ignorant ref

- Import arbitrary structure (drag/copy/paste)
- Control
	- ignoring attachment of where came from, from which would follow the others as the same ignoring again the compariosn, collapsing the tei structures into each other ; ignoring the embedding. - Basically driving them to some "0 point"
	- Expand/collapse/superpose arbitrarily.
		- Can at each step choose which continuations to follow (`step`)
	- Bind structures to controls ; copy/paste, this key does this
	- Single key to show something for everything, ignored structure, could just me a simple program applied to the whole interface, show me all the 'orbits' on all the structure.
		- Basically: use loop to create line, rolling the loop oit by introducing variance in the traversing direction  
	- Some intuitive slider of some level of description over an existing interpretation to match it - quite dynamic
	- Draw arbitrary continuation to another level of description, basically taking some structure, trying to hook it into another structure ; Say the 2d grid of the screen into the cells of the gpu or something etc..
	- [ ] Which moves one can make depicted visually (<>, circular, etc..) 

	- draw with mouse, multiple in a line
	- Like a paintbrush slowly growing in certain directions having particular steuctures.

- [ ] If you ahve to use mouse, force lock on the structure, close to the mouse?? ; Generalized to drawing in, but this is also a bit of a problem when generalized.

Always, how detailed, how much context, how much can it latch on etc..
- Drag from one point of contact on the background to another place
