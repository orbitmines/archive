### SYCO12  
- [[Miriam Backens]]  
- [Graphical rewriting of quantum computations using the ZX-calculus and flow properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08166)
  
  
before:  
flow preservaring, as in the kepeing of the continuations, nonbreaking into the continuation? -> Preservation of that property, in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the structure.  
  
  
correction function basde on wrong opservered behavior, interesting, possibly related to extremes inhibited,  
oneway  
  
flow preserving, just the circuit which is a particular interface which can perform something, and then the error correction is just trying to force the eisting thing into that interface. which is quite similar to a lot of things i'm headed to; namely changable interfaces, then the interesting thing would be what if the quantum circuit itself is changable and has connections to the things outside the circuit (obviously)  
  
Clear that this whole "certain complexity" here is also stopping exploration into more unusualvariants. Even with something like ZX. You never really consider the representation or everything like context. it's not they're consistent. They're consistent in some way, take in context, it falls apart. this concept is quite overarching: Still, how does i actually break down/ is it the infinite self-refernece recusion, or?  
  
Always this oh,w e have some other way of visually representing it, the hgate and the blue lines, again that itself is the same sort of problem, it's just not paid attention to.\\  
  
Yeah quite certain this merging in ZX is just a Ray onlg something related *as in the only difference is the difference of that ray and hence it allows for collapsing/expanding in that direction. It's an inconsistency, ignorance along a ray.  
  
Yep vertex splitting is moving to another perspective of the ray at the boundary, Either from the perspective of the boundary, or that of the rays joining at the boundary. "Vertex splitting is useful for reducing counts" -> There's no counts by default.  
  
Non-stabaliser, just incompatable with the interface?  
  
aS a thought after this: need to make it clear that all these languages of attaching names to things or wanting it to be kept in a spiecific way is very unhelpful.  
  
descrepency over this "one-way" it's always: You have some asymmtry, and need a symmtry for that or the other way around. and the solution of the guy *who is he alexei next talk) in front of me, this hardware software is close but not right for "oneway" it's not the right solution. it's just that you have the other level of description: which is basically the other side of traversing on another level of description which allows for the "one-way" side since this is invered from the lower-level abstraction which is the type of the ray structure underneath, hence probably his referencing f soft/hardware, but this his is not the right language for it. it's just this lack of being able to deal with these dichotomies again?  
  
the further you get away from flwo the ahrder it is to maintain, it's probably again interference of other local things which change it from a single arbirarily ray to some interfering ones.  

  
- [[David Forsman]]  
- Monoidal Meta-Theorem  
  
Universal as in context independence. Then rewriting is harder.  
inability to do the tensor operation is what defines irreversibility?  
Programming with edge relationship looked interesting  
  
- [[Paul Blain Levy]]  
- Game-enriched categories  
  
game semenatics  
  
Higher level languages as game-dynamics, similar to how taleins planning on setting up the higher-level translations? Or what that just to interaction combinators.  
  
abramsky mcCusher, Idealized algol  
HOnda  
Murawski Tzvev  
  
objects, arenas  
Probabilistic nnot on its own enough, structured way just different levels of abstraction for probabilities. Then you can get something interesting with rays, where the way you push the strcuture through some branching structure which determines which branches are taken by that structure being pushed through *ie how to choosing through the branching, limited by how much is pushed through. Like a fluid / eectricity or wahaetver  
  
Harmer and Mccusher  
levi  
danos and Harmer  
Again causal problem arsies here obivously(  
  
equivariant, seen before last year or something, probably worth understanding, but just seems like some special invariance? *structure, but what kind? again, nongenerality(  
  
Hyland?  
  
morphism is a strategy for game A-> B&A  
  
Games encirched in highlands category of gband? "not just cateogires' ? Basically somesymmtries again which cut down the work" ; Being the generalized way ; this keeps coming up  
  
homgame  
  
Restrictive form of change in base  
  
all this naming is clearly not helpful, there's needs to be good solutions for this, dunno yet  
  
LEft entry and all the other ones come for free. ?  
change of base.? move to a common language??

- Ignorance of the functor is absolute equality
- Yeah you make the symmetries an asymmytry by having it described on another level of descripton as how the traversal is done.  
- Structure on the edge, as a way of asking for types, basically pu tstuff as typingfinding on the terminal/initial
