### SYCO12  
- [[Miriam Backens]]  
- [Graphical rewriting of quantum computations using the ZX-calculus and flow properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08166)
  
  
before:  
flow preservaring, as in the kepeing of the continuations, nonbreaking into the continuation? -> Preservation of that property, in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the structure.  
  
  
correction function basde on wrong opservered behavior, interesting, possibly related to extremes inhibited,  
oneway  
  
flow preserving, just the circuit which is a particular interface which can perform something, and then the error correction is just trying to force the eisting thing into that interface. which is quite similar to a lot of things i'm headed to; namely changable interfaces, then the interesting thing would be what if the quantum circuit itself is changable and has connections to the things outside the circuit (obviously)  
  
Clear that this whole "certain complexity" here is also stopping exploration into more unusualvariants. Even with something like ZX. You never really consider the representation or everything like context. it's not they're consistent. They're consistent in some way, take in context, it falls apart. this concept is quite overarching: Still, how does i actually break down/ is it the infinite self-refernece recusion, or?  
  
Always this oh,w e have some other way of visually representing it, the hgate and the blue lines, again that itself is the same sort of problem, it's just not paid attention to.\\  
  
Yeah quite certain this merging in ZX is just a Ray onlg something related *as in the only difference is the difference of that ray and hence it allows for collapsing/expanding in that direction. It's an inconsistency, ignorance along a ray.  
  
Yep vertex splitting is moving to another perspective of the ray at the boundary, Either from the perspective of the boundary, or that of the rays joining at the boundary. "Vertex splitting is useful for reducing counts" -> There's no counts by default.  
  
Non-stabaliser, just incompatable with the interface?  
  
aS a thought after this: need to make it clear that all these languages of attaching names to things or wanting it to be kept in a spiecific way is very unhelpful.  
  
descrepency over this "one-way" it's always: You have some asymmtry, and need a symmtry for that or the other way around. and the solution of the guy *who is he alexei next talk) in front of me, this hardware software is close but not right for "oneway" it's not the right solution. it's just that you have the other level of description: which is basically the other side of traversing on another level of description which allows for the "one-way" side since this is invered from the lower-level abstraction which is the type of the ray structure underneath, hence probably his referencing f soft/hardware, but this his is not the right language for it. it's just this lack of being able to deal with these dichotomies again?  
  
the further you get away from flwo the ahrder it is to maintain, it's probably again interference of other local things which change it from a single arbirarily ray to some interfering ones.  

  
- [[Aloïs Rosset]], [[Maaike Zwart]], [[Helle Hvid Hansen]], [[Jörg Endrullis]]  
- Correspondence between Composite Theories and Distributive Laws  
  
way to construct the zero thing is to have the opposite etremes; initial terminal, arbitrarily structured, be next to each other and then cancel each other out when we ignore the difference, Very much like the ZX thing of anniliation  
  
the two separate rows in composeiste theories, separate again arejust two parallel strands composed seperately, which we describe through another level of abstraction, just branching of the rays.  
  
Terminaing + local confluence _> gen confluence. What was that paper? Might have heard of it before (where?)  
  
Not the right solution for the rewriting structure: Again rays can just do this branching. THough the colors show this? "how deep in the structure" -> Just same thing but described differently.  
  
commutes, invariance  
  
- [[Adrián Doña Mateo]]  
- Pushing monads forward  
  
Ring over the field, ignorance of the structure of the overlapping field to make it a ring?  
; Just overlapping of the fields? And then drawing lines between these things.  
Pushforward as in the modularity of the ring over the field?  
  
- [[David Forsman]]  
- Monoidal Meta-Theorem  
  
Lot of noncopying, nonuniqueness. - This is basically you want ignorance of the assymetrical structure which allows you to point that out, while also simultaneously make sure the ones matching are collapses together. in the case of arbitrary refernces, this might as well be better to combines them together with equivalences like functors on everything. AS a way of saying, yes, it's definitenly different, but pretty much the same. then you cgain get the functor construction where it branches arbitrarily through the structure as a single ray in the way of defining a single ray.  
  
Universal as in context independence. Then rewriting is harder.  
  
so sure local rewriting, but then with certain properties held after is the hard part. So that's what the ray also need a better hold on. At least the traversing is there. But then like with filters/partial stuff be able to like in the ZX/quantum stuff perform corrections, or perturb the system in such a way to change its behavior to something else  
  
context as in simply just recursively linking all the different abstraction levels ; like ray?  
  
multicategory again just structure preserving of a category, just again the same thing applied on a different context?  
  
enriched??  
  
multicatgeory encoded in enriched, or the other way around?  
  
- [[Aziz Kharoof]]  
- Homotopical characterization of strong contextuality  
  
?  
  
- [[Joshua Wrigley]]  
- A topos-theoretic framework for reconstruction theorems in model theory  
  
Drawing lines between the different lines of description  
  
Sheave, bundlehthing carrying the fucntion just lazy or the func on the whole thing by doing it local or traversing the entire thing.  
  
"if and only if" ; why not just "if" - :cry: - Similar, doesnt solve the problem: "more if than if"  
  
  
  
##### Tuesday  
  
- [[Sean Moss]]  
- Random graph models - The markov category if a graph  
  
Exchangeable (invariant) consistent (invariant in some restricted sense) local  
  
cone algebraic, branching ; all similar ideas (had some notes from Aleks kissingers paper somewhee for this too, Milewski pribably mentuond it on his kecture series too)  
  
Monoidal cone  
  
Reminded of this thing Jonathan gorard said at some point at send iirc (check this not sure could've been something close to it?); inability to do the tensor operation is what defines irreversibility?  
  
Programming with edge relationship looked interesting  
  
I'll probably have to look into the distributivity at aome point  
  
large networks and graph limits ; some weird quircks in general case but still  
  
topos/rado-noiminal sets  
categorical structures / algebraic constraints of random graph models  
  
  
- [[Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis]]  
- Compositional statistical mechanics, entropy and variational inference  
  
Stsatistical system as projective planes of observables  
This seems related to relating the compositional structures to quantuk phyaics as Jonathan Goarard & others had done in one of their papers on hypergraphs - or they relied on other work? - Look thsis up and try to understand these two layers  
  
This area looks interesting, look up if he's made something more graphical as an entry point, some good ideas here.  
  
perturbetsivr case  
  
- [[Filippo Bonchi]], [[Alessandro Di Giorgio]], [[Nathan Haydon]], [[Paweł Sobocinski]]  
- Diagrammatic Algebra of First Order Logic  
  
The black/white thing just needs to genwralized ti context within the thing itself. Just some ray on each of the other things too.  
  
Davida Trotta?  
  
Functor box?  
  
  
- [[Bruno Gavranović]], [[Paul Lessard 1]], [[Andrew Joseph Dudzik]], [[Tamara von Glehn]], [[João Guilherme Madeira Araújo]], [[Petar Veličković]]  
- Categorical Deep Learning: An Algebraic Theory of Architectures  
  
equivarianceequivariance with respect to invertable  
  
Lie derativat th emeasuring learned equivariance  
  
the f-colalrbgras are what alex kissinger was working with/mentioned? So it's the hypergraph rewriting? Or the frobenius ones??  
  
not lensises, just forward pass.  
  
Just endofunctor, so smaller lowerlevel, instead of monad, high abstraction?  
  
- [[Pablo Donato]]  
- The Flower Calculus  
  
Existential graphs pierce 1896  
  
  
- [[Nathan Corbyn]], [[Lukas Heidemann]], [[Nick Hu]], [[Chiara Sarti]], [[Calin Tataru]], [[Jamie Vicary]]  
- homotopy.io: a proof assistant for finitely-presented globular n-categories  
  
  
  
- [[Tanguy Massacrier]], [[Philippe Malbos]], [[Georg Struth]]  
- Single-set cubical categories and their formalisation with a proof assistant  
  
  
Work in isabelle, the cubicalagda? homotopy, higher-dimensional rewriting.  
  
brown, higgings  
  
also connected to the omega category mentioned elsewhere  
  
Forgetting of lower structures, as long as higher abstraction is still applicable. Makes sense, no need to think about all these layers simultaenously, But then like in other things: less structure easier to intrepret  
  
again these omega strcutures, only way this modularity or any symmetry makes much sense is some assymmetrical handle on it  
  
"how mcuh reach" very much like how many composition of the ray  
  
- [[Paul Blain Levy]]  
- Game-enriched categories  
  
game semenatics  
  
Higher level languages as game-dynamics, similar to how taleins planning on setting up the higher-level translations? Or what that just to interaction combinators.  
  
abramsky mcCusher, Idealized algol  
HOnda  
Murawski Tzvev  
  
objects, arenas  
Probabilistic nnot on its own enough, structured way just different levels of abstraction for probabilities. Then you can get something interesting with rays, where the way you push the strcuture through some branching structure which determines which branches are taken by that structure being pushed through *ie how to choosing through the branching, limited by how much is pushed through. Like a fluid / eectricity or wahaetver  
  
Harmer and Mccusher  
levi  
danos and Harmer  
Again causal problem arsies here obivously(  
  
equivariant, seen before last year or something, probably worth understanding, but just seems like some special invariance? *structure, but what kind? again, nongenerality(  
  
Hyland?  
  
morphism is a strategy for game A-> B&A  
  
Games encirched in highlands category of gband? "not just cateogires' ? Basically somesymmtries again which cut down the work" ; Being the generalized way ; this keeps coming up  
  
homgame  
  
Restrictive form of change in base  
  
all this naming is clearly not helpful, there's needs to be good solutions for this, dunno yet  
  
LEft entry and all the other ones come for free. ?  
change of base.? move to a common language??  

---  
  
- Ignorance of the functor is absolute equality
- Yeah you make the symmetries an asymmytry by having it described on another level of descripton as how the traversal is done.  
- Structure on the edge, as a way of asking for types, basically pu tstuff as typingfinding on the terminal/initial
