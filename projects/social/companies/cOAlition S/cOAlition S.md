2019:
- In the Netherlands the Dutch Research Council (NWO), including ZonMW, has joined cOAlition S and will implement Plan S from 2021 onwards
- This means that Utrecht University/UMCU researchers whose research is funded by NWO and ZonMW must comply with the requirements mentioned above.
- Expectations are that also the European Committee (H2020 and its successor Horizon Europe) and the European Research Council (ERC) will implement Plan S.
