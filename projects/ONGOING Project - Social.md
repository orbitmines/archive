Depending on a few factors (mainly funding for now) the @OrbitMines project will probably start accelerating in scope this year.

Live changes of roadmap-related things can now also be found in the  https://github.com/orbitmines/archive/tree/main/projects repository. (Basically for high-frequency changes) I'll put a general "roadmap" of projects in there in the coming weeks.

I'll still use the ‚Å†https://discord.orbitmines.com for lower-frequency updates on the projects. Social media & and the beginnings of streams for more general information. 

I think I now finally understand the problem space properly and am turning my eye to implementation only from now on.

Continuing implementation work on Rays tomorrow: let's see how far I can get before heading to #SYCO12 (Birmingham, UK 15-16 April): https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/12/ (Local organizers: @Tnttodda & @thegeorgejkaye)

Doing work in a separate repository: https://github.com/orbitmines/ray

Notice me @NGI4eu @NLnetFDN, exploratory research is the future~

## OrbitMines as ** Project

<Arc head="Introduction">  
  I'm finding myself having to write something along these lines more often recently, so I'm not even sure what a thing like this should be called. Perhaps this is a comprehensive guide on how to be frustrated with pixels. Containing a bit of personal history, a bit of future projections and too many vague ideas which need a practical handle - Ah, that'll be the future projection part.  
  
  <BR/><BR/>  
  
  Perhaps this should make communicating these things easier by just being able to share a link. An online copy of this can be found <Reference is="reference" simple inline index={referenceCounter()} reference={{title: 'here', link: 'https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project'}} />.  
  
  <BR/><BR/>  
  
  As a follow up of a recent <Reference is="reference" simple inline index={referenceCounter()} reference={{title: 'post', link: 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fadishawki_lookingforwork-looking-funding-activity-7162063253718691840-sf38'}} />, this is a letter I've sent to a plentiful of people, which outlines the category of project OrbitMines will be. Please feel to share this with anyone who could help me make these things happen. As with anything with me, this thing is so flexibly general that it should survive any sudden shift in direction I occasionally tend to make.

  <Section sub="">  
    <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>Probably more accurately, this is <b>OrbitMines as a <span className="bp5-text-muted">(Programming) Language, Version Control, Compiler, Browser, Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Operating System, ..., Game</span> Project</b>. Though "OrbitMines as a Game Project" is probably more provocative and more accurately represents the most important part of this project: its (visual) interface.</span>  
  
    <BR/><BR/>  
    The very example that all those things are so isolated from each-other as concepts itself is shows the entirety of this complex problem. But for a lot of good practical reasons, it is quite understandable that such a thing happens. Simplifying, - compression -, is hard.  
  
    <BR/><BR/>  
  
    <span style={{textAlign: 'left', minWidth: '100%'}}>  
      A broader interpretation of this approach is probably more along the lines of instead of attacking any single problem directly, or to solve any definite problem. To instead assume we can't actually generally do that, and to find tools as generally as possible that can be applied as conveniently as possible. I don't care how its details work, what can you <b>do with it</b>? But not only that, it needs to be satisfying to learn, to explore. The only example I know of which has achieved this for a general audience are video games. Specifically for this category of problem, sandbox video games.

    Ok, enough abstract vagueness without content, onward! ... to less abstract vagueness:  
  
    <BR/><BR/>  
  
    This problem, though filled with incredible technical complexity, in its essence is a visual design problem: What should it feel like? What should it look like?  
  
    <BR/><BR/>  
  
    That makes our lives in a certain respect much easier. Because it's definitely not remotely like anything I've seen before.

### Design

There's something entirely problematic about certain types of convenient solutions. Take for instance the interface that is the cursor of a computer people are familiar. And the type of visual interface that i . But there's something quite unsatisfying about keyboard too, it might be better for scale in many cases: But the functionality attached to certain patterns of keyboard-interactions are hidden to the unknowing user. It is seriously hard to find out or spend the time to understand what is even possible in any interface with the keyboard. A more general pattern which is not just applicable to this: once something seemingly convenient is found, it is seriously hard to explore and steer away from that.

#### First feel
In broad terms this is how the game should initially feel: It looks like you're playing something like Minecraft, but then at some point comes the realization that it can be used to do/create *anything*.
You shouldn't even notice you're doing things which could be interpreted as science/engineering. - The moment that you realize you can, you can tap into that.



### Open World Generation
Anything that's *generated, ..., created* which is *accessible, not forgotten and understandable* can be visited as a location. This for example includes whatever intro-screen the game has.

Big challenge is probably ignoring an existing generated world, and instantiating new generation on that same location. Either superposed, ..., portal ... - 

Stability of Space
Non-stability of arbitrary complicated information
