Live changes of roadmap-related things can now also be found in the  https://github.com/orbitmines/archive/tree/main/projects repository. (Basically for high-frequency changes) I'll put a general "roadmap" of projects in there in the coming weeks.

I'll still use the ‚Å†https://discord.orbitmines.com for lower-frequency updates on the projects. Social media & and the beginnings of streams for more general information. 

I think I now finally understand the problem space properly and am turning my eye to implementation only from now on.

Depending on a few factors (mainly funding for now) the project will probably start accelerating in scope this year.
