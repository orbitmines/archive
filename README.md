# Public Excerpt of OrbitMines' Research Journal & Archive
*A log of OrbitMines, exposed, through time: Technical Tangents, Research and Literary Exposure*

---

###### What's excluded?
- People-specific information, except for their relevance to certain projects.
- Offline-held copies of publications - instead replaced with a link.
- A backward log before the public side of the journal was setup (< [[2024-03-07]]).
- Stuff I would deem too confused that evidently I flagged it for exclusion (more likely to be social-related things)
- Private documents not designed for publication (Letters, invoices etc...)
